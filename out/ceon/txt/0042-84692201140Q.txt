Introduction 
The first applications of binary algebra started several decades ago. 
The entire mathematical concept is based on the set theory which deals 
with two basic elements: 0 and 1. Engineers of the 20th century 
discovered semiconductor technology that represents 0 and 1 as the 
definite voltage values: 0 V and 5 V. In such a way, that paradigm has 
gotten its physical sense as in digital electronics where it deals with real 
electricity fields. The idea of the given mathematical model is quite 
simple and it relies on the fundamental and proven theorems of binary

PRELIMINARY COMMUNICATIONS 
logics. This paper demonstrates a complete set of mathematical models, 
digital circuits, and truth tables as well as proofs that serve to illustrate a 
digital logic scheme being capable of neutralizing any signal or a set of 
signals coming to its input. In other words, whatever is given at the input 
will be made into 0 at its output. This is feasible as any signal being 
ANDed with its inverted variation is equal to 0. Apparently, such a model 
can be assumed as a singularity in the voltage field and some testing 
graphs in such a context will be described. Also, this paper will introduce 
a completely new approach to binary algebra offering a chance to 
analyze such an energy area in a set of real numbers. In the essence, 
this modelling can serve in software and hardware production as there 
have been a lot of benefits from a static absorber that can be applied in 
cyber industry. Indeed, there have been a lot of pluses and minuses of 
such a solution and this article will address how to use its advantages 
and, consequently, avoid some drawbacks. (Djekic, 2020b), (Djekic, 
2021e), (Djekic, 2021d)  
In general, technology has always been a responsibility of the one 
who applies it and for such a reason it is important to appeal to everyone 
being in possession of something powerful to deal with it with 
selflessness, not selfishness. 
It has been quite easy to pass by things without noticing anything. 
Once mankind has had an eye for details, it will progress much faster 
than ever. The nature is full of wonders that wait for humans to pay 
attention to them. Apparently, that is how the biggest discoveries in 
science were made. Next, there has been a question how well the 
current natural phenomena were explained and understood. For 
instance, it is well known that an original signal with its inversion at the 
input of the AND logic gate always gives 0 at the output. Boolean algebra 
can mathematically prove such a theorem and, indeed, digital electronics 
can provide these circuits to work accurately. Indeed, it has been 
necessary to sort things out intelligently in order to get their maximum 
performance. In other words, it is like testing the mathematical and 
logical IQ by attempting to fit the right shape object into the right opening. 
Another good question about such a theory could be: Where will all that 
energy go if anything at the input gives nothing at the output? It seems 
something has been very strange with such a circuit as it behaves like a 
singular point pulling everything inside. On the other hand, if that logic 
configuration were to behave like a sink, it would need better 
mathematical modelling to be better tackled. Also, there has been a 
strong need for computer simulations as well as experimental 
examinations in order to gain a deep insight into all scientific secrets. 
Humankind may not be at that degree of technological development at 
present, but the ongoing tendency suggests that the modern world could 
be on a good track to make a better use of current endeavors. 
Next, there has been a sense of wonder how such a fundamental 
Boolean rule could serve in cyber security. The majority of the present IT 
security solutions are based on binary algebra. On the other hand, the 
marketplace is literally overwhelmed with highly expensive, but not that 
effective analytical tools. In other words, cyber defense analysts sitting in 
their security operating centers (SOCs) can recognize if anyone has 
been trying to make a breach and maintain connection with some 
network’s device, but in order to protect their asset from such an attack 
they need to terminate that signal manually. It is an appealing message, 
is it not? In the 21st century, something is still needed to be done with 
hands. How inconvenient?! Apparently, if it is feasible to recognize web’s 
anomalies, it should be possible to terminate them automatically letting 
only trusted devices exchange the information with a well-protected grid. 
Indeed, there has been something which could absorb any signal and if 
there were an opportunity to pass only untrusted connections through 
that absorber, all unwanted behaviors would be banned in a sub-second 
period of time. No more breaches, right? At this stage, it is about how to 
prevent or probably reduce such a concern; however, if the right things 
are put into right places, the best possible performances are expected. 
(Djekic, 2017), (Đekić, 2021)  
In a similar way, hackers can get a brilliant idea creating a malware 
that can neutralize the internet connectivity and put into quarantine any 
infected object. In total, everything is still an idea which can become a 
reality in the coming time. 
The purpose of this idea is to improve the effectiveness of the 
incident response turning active defense into the passive one or, in other 
words - converting monitoring and incident responses into extremely 
intelligent prevention. There has been a need to develop a computer 
code very smartly so that it could differentiate trusted from untrusted 
behaviors on the web. (Djekic, 2021a), (Djekic, 2021b), (Djekic, 2021c)  
Maybe it is not that much about artificial intelligence as it has been 
about allowing the communication through a well-developed algorithm 
that can make a decision, not think for real. Also, there is a need for anti-
breach software, where the attacker leaves an IP address, but cannot 
establish communication with a targeted device for being rejected any 
time an attempt occurs. In other words, it is a sort of communication 
filtering and quite good protection due to which cyber warfare could be 
history if appropriately applied. The entire concept can be imagined as 
the informatics body armor of cyber warriors that cannot be wounded or 
killed on their positions once they apply such a shield. The model is 
called static since it uses only logic gates without returning branches that 
could consist of some memory elements.       
Mathematical models using binary algebra 
The set theory is a well-developed and researched area of 
mathematics which has many applications in everyday life. On the other 
hand, there is binary algebra that deals with only two unique elements, 0 
and 1. Such a field of science has found many usages in electronics, 
especially digital, as the entire modern computer science applies the 
results of these explorations. In this research, it has been investigated 
how it is possible to do modelling of logic circuits without any dynamics 
applied to them in order to analyze and simulate their behavior excluding 
real experimental conditions and laboratory testing. Also, no coding has 
been done in this research as it presents an idea how to develop a code 
so far as mathematical modelling can contribute in making both hardware 
and software.  
A basic static absorber can be obtained if original and inverted 
signals are settled at the input of the AND logic gate. The mathematical 
description is given in equation (1) as follows: 
B A A=                                                        (1) 
where: 
A  - is an input to the AND logic gate which is in affirmation; 
A  - is an input to the AND logic gate which is in negation; and 
B - is an output of the AND logic gate with two inputs so far. 
In other words, any combination at the input will give 0 at the output 
causing the signal to just disappear. This is given in equation (2) as 
follows: 
0A A =                                                       (2) 
where: 
A  - is an input to the AND logic gate which is in affirmation and 
A  - is an input to the AND logic gate which is in negation. 
This can be examined in the truth table that is given in Table 1 as 
follows:  
Table 1 – Truth table of the initial static absorber 
Таблица 1 – Таблица истинности исходного статического абсорбера 
Табела 1 – Истинитосна табела иницијалног статичког апсорбера 
Next, an illustration of the basic static absorber digital circuit will be 
provided. The illustration is made in Logic Circuit Designer software that 
can offer quite a reliable simulation option. Figure 1 is given as follows.  
Figure 1 – Basic static absorber circuit 
Рис. 1 – Базовая схема статического абсорбера 
Слика 1 – Основно коло статичког апсорбера 
The illustration represents the AND logic gate with 2 inputs which 
are, in this case, the original signal and its inverted version. If equations 
(1) and (2) are taken into consideration with their truth table (given in 
Table 1), it is quite obvious that the results of the simulation will be 
identical to the given mathematical description. In this case, such a 
model has gotten its proof and it is highly recommended that software 
developers make an attempt to create a program that can work as given 
through this modelling. Also, it is obvious that any entry at the input of 
this circuit will absorb the signal and give 0 as its output. Further, it will be 
explained why such a sort of mathematical models could be considered 
as a singularity as it literally neutralizes any electricity coming in. In other 
words, it can be discussed that everything given in equations (1) and (2) 
as well as in their truth table and logic diagram will be like a sink to 
anything at the input. The recommendation is to go deeper into the 
analysis of electronic circuits in order to completely understand such 
semiconductor technology as well as the behavior of the applied 
electronic elements. Digital electronics is a field with so many areas to 
investigate and at this stage there has been insufficient awareness about 
the opportunity that such a branch of science and technology can offer so 
far.  
This paper will demonstrate how a slightly complicated model of the 
static absorber can be developed. In such a case, through simple 
mathematics and proof using truth tables and logic simulations, it will be 
shown how this model can find its applications in practice. From this 
standpoint, it is possible to begin with a mathematical model that relies 
on Boolean algebra and combines the AND, OR and NOT logic 
functions. The description of the model is given in equation (3) as follows: 
( ) ( )C A A B B=  +                                       (3) 
where: 
A  - is an input to the AND logic gate which is in affirmation; 
A  - is an input to the AND logic gate which is in negation;  
B  - is an input to the AND logic gate which is in affirmation; 
B  - is an input to the AND logic gate which is in negation; and 
C  - is an output of the OR logic gate that always gives nothing for a 
result as its inputs are always 0. 
As given in equations (1) and (2), something AND its inversion are 
always equal to nothing; so, if everything is submitted into equation (3), it 
will be continued with equation (4) as follows:  
0 0 0C = + =                                            (4) 
where:   
C  - is an output of the OR logic gate that always gives nothing for a 
result as its inputs are always 0. 
In practice, the OR logic gate gives nothing only if all its inputs do 
not have a signal as their incoming value. Such modelling can serve in 
designing much complicated logic circuitries. Apparently, the real clues to 
this modelling can be obtained via equation (3) the truth table of which is 
given in Table 2 as follows:  
Table 2 – Truth table of the complex static neutralizer  
Таблица 2 – Таблица истинности комплексного статического нейтрализатора 
Табела 2 – Истинитосна тебела комплексног статичког неутрализатора 
A B C 
0 0 0 
0 1 0 
1 0 0 
1 1 0 
The truth table given above is the evidence of the well-developed 
mathematical model whose logic circuit is given in Figure 2 as follows: 
Figure 2 – Logic diagram of a complicated static absorber 
Рис. 2 – Логическая схема сложного статического абсорбера 
Слика 2 – Логички дијаграм компликованог статичког апсорбера 
The static absorber is possible to be designed applying so simple 
and fundamental logic functions available in both hardware and software 
formats. The further research will try to handle a set of real numbers in 
order to examine all possibilities of an energetic field as well as some 
characteristics of semiconductor technology typical to silicon-based 
solutions. It will also introduce a kind of mathematical transformations 
from a set of binary numbers into a set of real numbers trying to invoke 
the entire new area of mathematics that could find its applications in 
future scientific research and explorations. In other words, it will be 
necessary to thoroughly understand the physical characteristics of digital 
technology since it can cope, as far as it is known at this stage, with the 
singular points in some scalar or vector fields, suggesting maybe that 
future investigations will need a better understanding of the field theory. 
At this stage, it is feasible to offer some ideas and indeed, the entire 
investigation can be so time-consuming and can need a great deal of  
effort from the scientific community worldwide.    
Examining functions in a set of real numbers  
Boolean algebra is a part of the set theory that consists of two basic 
elements: 0,1 . It seems the binary numbers deal with duality since 
they can be described as a series of 0s and 1s. Quantum mechanics 
suggests that the entire nature deals with duality and oscillates between 
two basic states, matter and energy. At this stage, it is quite hasty to 
make any sort of correlations as there is a need for more profound 
research in both theoretical and empirical manner. The purpose of this 
effort is to bring forward some brand-new ideas and try to find a link 
between something already known. In this paper, it is discussed how to 
design a static absorber which, from the perspective of the field theory, 
could be regarded as a singularity in the energy field.  
Indeed, equations (1) and (2) provide some fundamental steps into 
such an investigation and, no matter what the inputs are, the output is 
always nothing. In theory, the absorber could neutralize any power as if 
some ways of signal conversion were applied. The recommendation is to 
make as many experimental attempts as possible since their results will 
help defense industry on its way to produce something that will truly work 
in practice. As mentioned before, binary algebra deals with two basic 
states like quantum physics, so in other words – maybe a Boolean 
analysis can be used for future research and modelling in that area of 
science.  
The real impact of this article will be described under this chapter as 
it is needed to introduce a completely new approach to binary logics as a 
fragment of mathematics that needs to deal with some practical 
applications as well as with a much deeper understanding of its 
theoretical paradigms. Further, this chapter will introduce how the binary 
functions can be presented in a set of real numbers making a 
comparative analysis of the input and output energetic fields. Everything 
will be illustrated in the 2-D and 3-D coordinate systems trying to 
encourage prospective researchers to give their contributions. It will be 
also explained how the previous mathematical models could be 
transferred in a set of real numbers not giving any analytics of the 
transitional function that could project the elements of the binary logics 
set into the set of real numbers. For such scientific research it may be 
necessary to gather a multidisciplinary expert team who would work on 
such a project for a longer period of time.   
Indeed, it is well-known that if equations (1) and (2) are dealt with in 
the binary set of numbers, such a correlation can give an equation in the 
real set of numbers as follows: 
( )1B A A=  −                                               (5) 
where: 
A  - is an input signal in affirmation that is multiplied with its 
negation; 
1 A−  - is an inverted input signal that is a negation of the input A  
which is in the sense of Boolean algebra illustrated as A ; and 
B  - is an output signal that is a product of affirmation and negation 
being brought at the inputs. 
In any case, the output of equation (5) is 0 which can be described 
with the truth table as follows: 
Table 3 – Truth table of the static absorber    
Таблица 3 – Таблица истинности статического абсорбера 
Табела 3 – Истинитосна тебела статичког апсорбера 
A 1-A B 
0 1 0 
1 0 0 
As illustrated in Table 3, for , , 0,1A B A B   , it has been 
feasible to prove that if the binary values have been taken for the inputs 
and the output, the result will always be a neutralized function that can be 
graphically represented in a set of real numbers  via the graph made in 
the 2-D and 2-D form using the 3D Grapher tool. These illustrations have 
been provided in the figures as follows.  
Figure 3 –  2-D graph of equation (5)  
Рис. 3 –2-Д график уравнения (5) 
Слика 3 – 2-Д графика једначине (5) 
Figure 3 shows how equation (5) behaves in the 2-D coordinate 
system indicating that it is about the square function if ( ), ,A B − + .  
In other words, in such a case, it is possible to compare a correlation 
between the input and output signals which can be voltage dealing first, 
with the values 0 V and 5 V as well as the rest of taken variables.  
The next illustration in the 3-D surrounding suggests how input and 
output voltages are dependable on each other. The graphical 
representation is given in Figure 4 as follows. 
Figures 3 and 4 give a closer insight into how equation (5), being the 
square function in a set of real numbers, behaves in the 2-D and 3-D 
space. If singular dots behave like a sink in this case, it is quite clear they 
can be analyzed as a curve as well as an entire surface in the 3-D 
environment. As explained through this chapter, the AND logic function in 
Boolean algebra can be represented as a product in a set of real 
numbers.  
Figure 4 –  3-D drawing of the singularity surface  
Рис. 4 – 3-Д рисунок  сингулярной поверхности 
Слика 4 – 3-Д цртеж сингуларне површине 
On the other hand, signals in affirmation and negation are given as 
described in equation (5). 3D Grapher software deals with the X-Y-Z 
coordinate system and in this case it is given that X=u, Y=v, and Z=u*(1-
u). De facto, the true correlation between the inputs and the output would 
be X=u, Y=1-u, and Z=u*(1-u). That means only in such a case it is 
possible to analyze the behavior of the inputs regarding the outputs.  
At this stage, it is sufficient to demonstrate the feasible singularity 
objects as practically there is only one input being either in affirmation or 
negation and its unique output deals as given above. The advice for 
future research is to make an attempt to compare input and output 
voltages in order to realize how they depend on each other and why such 
an energetic field neutralizes anything getting close to it.  
Further, it is significant to introduce the behavior of equations (3) 
and (4) in a set of real numbers. Their mathematical model is provided in 
equation (6) as follows: 
( ) ( )1 1C A A B B=  − +  −                                        (6) 
where:  
A  - is an input which is multiplied with its negation being ( )1 A− in 
which case these two inputs give some product as a result; 
B  - is an input which is multiplied with its negation being ( )1 B− in 
which case these two inputs give some product as a result; and 
C  - is an output of the big function which is in this case a sum of the 
variables mentioned above. 
The truth table of equation (6) is illustrated in Table 4 as follows. 
Table 4 – Proof of  equation (6) in the truth table 
Таблица 4 – Доказательство уравнения (6) в таблице истинности 
Табела 4 – Доказ једначине (6) у истинитосној табели 
A B C 
0 0 0 
0 1 0 
1 0 0 
1 1 0 
Apparently, it is necessary to illustrate, using 3D Grapher, how 
equation (6) deals in the 2-D and 3-D space leaving to other researchers 
to examine the behavior of the input and output energetic fields. At this 
level, it is enough to demonstrate such a behavior only in the sense of 
the X-Y-Z coordinate system. The illustration in the 2-D form is given in 
Figure 5 as follows. 
In this case, the 3D Grapher mathematical model includes two 
inputs and only one output whose correlations are given in Figures 5 and 
6. The model is as follows X=u, Y=v, and Z=u*(1-u)+v*(1-v) which can be 
assumed as a singular area seeking to be better investigated. In total, 
some initial ideas are given through this effort and there is a huge task 
for researchers, engineers, and scientists to develop more superior 
findings for the entire defense industry.

On the other hand, the 3-D variation of equation (6) is given in 
Figure 6 as follows.

Applications in cyber industry 
As it is well known, one of the biggest applications of Boolean 
algebra is within digital systems and their electronics. The overall 
computer science and engineering area relies on that mathematical 
landscape. One of the worst nightmares for any IT security professional 
is a breach into some IT infrastructure as that can mean loss of data, 
sabotage or espionage. Entire teams of cyber analysts have been 
employed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in order to discover and 
terminate any attempt to break into protected networks and establish 
communication between them and the hacker’s workstation. (Djekic, 
2021f), (Djekic, 2019), (Djekic, 2020a)  
The point is, these professionals will need to manage their 
surveillance capacities and disconnect manually any attempt of a breach. 
This is called a good incident response. In other words, monitoring 
software can recognize any anomalies in the cyberspace, but the incident 
response is not very effective as it is needed to be done manually. The 
idea of this research effort is to suggest that the effectiveness of the 
incident response could be improved by simply passing untrusted traffic 
through a static absorber and terminating it subsequently. The neutralizer 
would in such a case reject anything being unwanted and the total 
incident response could take only a few moments. The basic theory of 
such a concept is given in this paper and if the idea passes some deeper 
analyses it could find its place in practice. At this stage, it is sufficient to 
be aware of such simple, but yet powerful abilities of binary numbers.   
Conclusion 
This paper discusses some possible capabilities of binary logics 
suggesting that a static absorber already has some initial modelling, 
while its dynamic version is still under development. The results given 
here can trigger an entirely novel research stream when these ideas 
become empirically verified. Finally, humankind has a skill to handle such 
superior technology, but the message is to be responsible while doing so.

Сажетак: 
Увод/циљ: Статички апсорбер, чија анализа  ће бити приказана у 
овом раду,  у стању је да неутрализује сваки сигнал у физичкој или 
виртуелној равни. . 
Методи: Представљено је искључиво научно размишљање и модел 
са објашњењима која су пажљиво евалуирана коришћењем 
софистицираних рачунарских алата за пројектовање и симулацију. 
Емпиријски резултати нису приложени, већ само тврдње са 
њиховим доказима. 
Резултати: Најзначајнији резултат овог истраживања јесте 
потпуно нови приступ бинарним системима који су овде повезани 
са скупом реалних бројева. 
Закључак: Сврха овог истраживања јесте да представи потпуно 
нови концепт који може да се користи у сајбер индустрији, док је 
динамичка варијанта апсорбера још увек у фази развоја. 
Кључне речи: високотехнолошка безбедност, сазнања, 
статички апсорбер, одбијање сигнала, хаковање, сингуларност, 
математичко моделовање.

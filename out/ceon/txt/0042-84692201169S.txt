Abstract: 
Introduction/purpose: To specify the practical application of ECMA-
355 and ECMA-336 Standards for Q-SIG tunneling and the 
implementation of mapping functions via the existing IP (Internet 
Protocol) network of the Serbian Armed Forces (Intranet SAF), in 
the Private Automatic Telephone Network SAF (PATN SAF), as 
the main part of the Private telecommunication-information 
networks of integrated  services SAF (PISN SAF). 
Methods: Description of the implemented solution and analysis of 
the software parameters of the established transmission SIP route,

echo in the network. 
Results: With such a solution, it was achieved that participants from 
the peripheral parts of the PISN SAF, which operate on the 
principle of transmission and circuit switching by TDM (Time 
Division Multiplexing), can connect with each other via the newly 
established central IP network SAF (Core network) which operates 
on the principle of transmission and switching packets with the SIP 
(Session Initiation Protocol), without losing the functionality of Q-
SIG from the framework of the digital telecommunication network of 
integrated services ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network).

Conclusion: The article deals with the modern IP PINX (Private 
Integrated Services Network Exchange) manufactured by Mitel, 
type MX-ONE Service Node 6.0, which is implemented at the 
transit level PATN SAF and which successfully implements the 
process of tunneling Q-SIG through the IP network and the 
necessary functions for mapping the transmission of tunneled Q-
SIG messages and mapping voice (and other audio) information to 
VoIP (Voice over IP) communication media streams through that 
network. Also, the basic elements for its software preparation 
during the introduction of a new SIP route, with a capacity of 30 IP 
trunks in a transmission beam realized with 100 Mb/s-T Ethernet, 
are given, and the fight with the present jitter and echo in the 
network is described. Finally, the paper presents the experience-
based values of the parameters for reducing the influence of jitter 
and suppressing echo.

Introduction 
The Serbian Armed Forces (SAF) is a specific organization that has 
its own, modern, functional telecommunications information system 
(FTIS), for sufficiently fast and quality processing and transmission of 
accurate and protected information (spoken and non-spoken). In the 
framework of transmission and switching of this information, the FTIS 
offers a wide range of modern telecommunication customer services and 
network services to users in the SAF. For their realization, The FTIS SAF 
provides stable technical support, not only on TDM (Time Division 
Multiplexing) but also on a modern IP (Internet Protocol) organized 
platform. 
The FTIS SAF is a functional, integrated telecommunication-
information platform, which, in addition to the fixed part, also contains a 
mobile component of the system (McTIS), primarily intended for 
communication on the ground and in combat conditions. Therefore - 
while respecting the complexity of the organization, the achieved degree 
of technical integration and geographical distribution - the FTIS SAF 
coincides with the performances, determinants and standards of a large 
modern CTN (Corporate Telecommunications Network). (Svrzić, 2019; 
Svrzić et al, 2021) 
About 15 years ago, in an important part of the FTIS SAF, i.e. in the 
Private Automatic Telephone Network SAF (PATN SAF), a network 
signaling system type Q-SIG (Q-Signalling), oriented to work on CCS 
(Common Channel Signaling), was put into operation, being specially 
designed and globally standardized for use in CTN (InterConnect 
Communication, 1995). Its application, in the PATN SAF, first provided 
the possibility for ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) 
interoperability between participating Digital Automatic Telephone 
eXchanges-DATX of different manufacturers. Later, this interoperability 
was provided between these DATX and the switching centers within the 
McTIS, as well as the switching center of the Digital Mobile Radio 
Network TETRA (Terestrial Trunking Radio) (Svrzić & Jovanovski, 
2021a; Svrzić et al, 2021b). Also, interoperability with PINX (Private 
Integrated Services Network eXchange) was provided from PTNs 
(Private Telecommunication Networks) of other armies or military 
alliances, with which the interconnection of the FTIS SAF is planned. In 
the end, of course, that interoperability is provided with the switching 
nodes of public mobile telephony operators in Serbia. (Svrzić, 2019; 
Svrzić et al, 2021) 
In this way, high integration has been achieved in the PATN SAF to 
date, both in terms of complete independence from various ISDN DATX 
manufacturers and in terms of achieving the planned scope of 
implementation of basic and additional customer services and network 
services (specified by the whole family of individual Q-SIG standards), 
which have become available to PATN SAF users, regardless of which 
network switching node they are connected to. However, the integrated 
FTIS SAF today, in addition to the TDM PISN (Private Integrated 
Services Network), also contains the Intranet SAF. The network layer 
protocol, in that IP network, is defined according to IETF RFC 760 and 
IETF RFC 791J Recommendations, while on the application layer the 
network is based on the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), which is 
defined according to IETF Recommendations RFC 3261J and IETF RFC 
3311. Such heterogeneous situation (existence of TDM and IP) 
immediately raised the question of the further application of Q-SIG in the 
PATN SAF, as a large part of the FTIS SAF, in terms of efficiency, 
economy and comprehensiveness of customer services and network 
services, not only on its homogeneous ISDN parts but also on parts with 
transport IP / SIP networks (proprietary IP networks within the Intranet). 
Also, it raised the question of the possibility of extending the service life 
of the existing switching equipment (PINX) during the time when the IP 
172  
platform will be the dominant medium for signal transmission between 
them. 
For these reasons, in the last few years, a certain number of node 
and transit DATXs have been completely replaced or modernized in the 
PATN SAF, which have (of course) become interoperable with the 
aforementioned proprietary newly built IP network (Intranet SAF). The 
Intranet SAF offers a packet mode of switching and transmission of all 
services (without connection) that are based on Internet Protocol, as the 
mentioned network layer protocol. The newly introduced, modern digital 
switching systems of Western origin are the so-called IP PINX, which are 
specially designed to work in the PISN and, using an integrated gateway, 
enabled to work with both ISDN and IP / SIP environment. At the same 
time, which is of crucial importance for their application in the PATN SAF, 
they enable the continuation of the successful functioning of network 
signaling of the Q-SIG type. Such IP PINXs today play the role of main 
entities in the PISN SAF, which basically consist of a switching function 
and a call management function. Of course, they successfully support the 
networking and implementation of all additional services and ANFs 
(Additional Network Features) with the application of Q-SIG, not only in 
accordance with previous Standards: ECMA-142, ECMA-143, ECMA-165 
and relevant individual Q-SIG standards from Annex D Reference: 
“QSIG. The Handbook for Communications Managers” (InterConnect 
Communication, 1995), (for the PINS part with TDM organized switching 
and transport network), but also in accordance with new ECMA-355 and 
ECMA-336 Standards (for the PINS part with IP organized switching and 
transport network). (Ecma International, 2002; Ecma International, 2008; 
Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 2019a; Svrzić et al, 2021; Svrzić & Jovanovski, 
2021a) 
Role of ECMA-355 and ECMA-336 Standards in the 
PATN SAF 
Let us recall that ECMA-355 Standard specifies a procedure for 
tunneling Q-SIG messages over the SIP, which is an application layer 
protocol for establishing, terminating, and modifying multimedia sessions. 
The SIP is usually transmitted over the IP, as a network layer protocol, so 
in this case phone calls are considered a type of multimedia session in 
which only audio signals are exchanged. Namely, in the real 
telecommunication network scenario SAF, the application of ECMA-355 
Standard solves the case where a Q-SIG call (or only signaling 
independent of the call), which originates from the "A" user connected to 
PINX from some TDM part of the PISN, passes through the central works 
with the IP network using the SIP, and ends with “B” of the user 
connected to the PINX from another TDM part of the PISN (or another 
PINX of the same TDM part of the PISN). It is very important to 
emphasize that during such a way of connecting, they manage to 
preserve all the possibilities of Q-SIG during the passage through the IP 
network. The reason for this is that by applying the Q-SIG tunneling 
procedure, its original messages are encapsulated within SIP requests 
and SIP responses, which are exchanged in the context of the prescribed 
SIP dialogue in the IP network. This then means that, by applying the 
tunneling procedure for the transmission of signaling messages from the 
Q-SIG, in the PATN SAF it is possible to call between PINX, i.e. "islands" 
within the parts of the PISN with circuit switching that use Q-signaling, 
and in the event that their interconnection (in one part) is realized by a 
transport IP network (which uses the SIP), without losing Q-SIG 
functionality. In such situations, PINX provides its participants with a 
regular Q-SIG call, or a Q-SIG call by type with independent signaling, as 
well as additional services and all ANFs, as the applied innovated ECMA-
355 Standard facilitates the introduction of improved SIP and SDP 
functionality (Session Description Protocol, defined by IETF 
Recommendation RFC 3264J). These improvements are of such a 
nature that they include the possibility of applying encryption of useful 
signals and mechanisms for more functional exchange of information 
(offers and responses) within the SDP, which (among other things) 
include mandatory renegotiation (i,e. negotiation and vice versa) during 
the exchange of SDP offers/responses on the part of the connection path 
with the IP network. (Ecma International, 2008; Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 
2021; Svrzić & Jovanovski, 2021a) 
In order to more precisely define the role of ECMA-355 Standard, 
which addresses the issue of modernized use of Q-SIG in the 
heterogeneous PATN SAF, it should be noted that it covers only the case 
of this type of connection in which an individual dialogue between two 
Gateways (edge IP PINX located at both ends of the transport IP 
network) is used to make one regular Q-SIG call (or one call-independent 
signaling connection), basically as defined in ECMA-165. This specifically 
means that ECMA-355 Standard in the PATN SAF applies only to 
situations where, on a part of the transport IP network, the SIP dialogue 
is initiated at the beginning of a regular Q-SIG call (or call-independent 
signaling) and deleted upon their completion (or interruption). An 
improved scenario, according to which one SIP dialogue would be 
maintained in the long run and used for tunneling messages of multiple 
174  
Q-SIG calls, or multiple connections of independent signaling, with a 
possibility to accept them at any time (including those calls that are just 
generated), is not supported in the specifications of the said ECMA 
standard, so it could not be applied within the PATN SAF. (Ecma 
International, 2008; Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 2019a; Svrzić et al, 2021) 
The implementation of the mapping functions in the IP switching 
systems PISN, which are necessary for the use of network intervention 
scenarios, in the PATN SAF is achieved using  ECMA-336 Standard, 
which is a pragmatic and broad-based consensus for regulating this area 
of work in the PISN. In fact, this standard specifies functions for using a 
packet network from an IP framework, as a network layer protocol. In this 
regard, ECMA-336 Standard specifies how to use the TCP (Transport 
Control Protocol), as the transport layer protocol defined by IETF 
Recommendation RFC 761, and the UDP (User Datagram Protocol), 
Recommendation IETF RFC 768, and to interconnect the two IP PINXs 
that make up the entities of heterogeneous PTNs (Private 
Telecommunications Networks), composed of marginal PISNs and 
central IP networks. The interconnection of the specified IP PINX, 
connected by the transport IP network, is achieved by transmitting the 
inter-PINX signaling protocol Q-SIG (as specified in ECMA-143, ECMA-
165 and other ECMA standards), directly via TCP, and by transmitting 
inter-PINX user information (e.g. speech), via the RTP (Real-time 
Transport Protocol), as defined by IETF RFC Recommendation 1889, 
whereby the RTP is transmitted within the UDP. 
According to ECMA-336 Standard, two types of inter-PINX 
connection (IPC) of participating IP PINX are envisaged: 
• “on demand”, where a separate TCP connection for Q-SIG is 
established at the beginning of each call and deleted at the end of that 
call; and 
• “semi-permanent”, where one TCP connection with unlimited 
duration transmits Q-SIG on behalf of multiple individual calls. 
To comply with this standard, each IP PINX in the PATN SAF 
constructively meets the reference configuration defined in ECMA-133 
Standard and the requirements set out in the implementation of the 
Implementation PICS (Conformance Statement Proforma), the text and 
form of which are defined in the Annex A of ECMA-336 Standard. Their 
switching and call management functions communicate logically, via the 
Q point instance, on both connected IP PINXs. This communication is 
known as an IPL (Inter-PINX link) and contains a signal channel, known 
as a DQ channel, and one or more channels for user information, each 
known as a UQ channel. One or more IPLs can be established in many 
ways between the same pair of cooperating IP PINXs. Specifically, in the 
PATN SAF, some realized IPLs use IP-based IVN (Intervening Network) 
services. Each IP PINX is physically connected to the IVN at a reference 
point “C”, and the IVN then provides connections, defined as Inter-PINX 
connections between the reference points “C” of the end PINXs. This 
then means that the mapping functions, within each of the IP PINX, map 
the DQ channel and UQ channels at the reference point “Q” to one or 
more IPCs, which are then held via the reference points “C”. 
In the PATN SAF, where the IVN is IP-based, ECMA-336 Standard 
is used to specify mapping functions to establish the following types of 
IPC: 
• For a TCP connection, used to transmit Q-SIG signaling messages 
and RCI (Resource Control Information). 
• To establish a pair of UDP streams, one stream in each direction, 
to transmit user information (audio and others) over the RTP. 
Connecting participating IP PINXs means that the IPL requires one 
TCP connection, to support the DQ channel, and one pair of UDP 
streams, to support the UQ channels, and a TCP connection (in addition 
to carrying the Q-SIG protocol) is also required to transmit information on 
resource control (RCI), which are essential for establishing UDP flows.

Description of the IP PINX manufacturer MITEL type 
MX-ONE Service Node 6.0 from the PATN SAF 
In the current PATN SAF, the main representative of the mentioned 
IP PINX is Mitel's switching system of the type MX-ONE Service Node 
6.0, which is by nature a SIP Soft Switch for SaaS applications 
(Software-as-Service). In the PATN SAF, this type of IP PINX was 
introduced for its modernization, as it provides users with all integrated IP 
communications services (modern voice and video services and 
functions), but also, through the integrated Media Gateway (MGW), very 
successfully enables servicing inherited protocols, services and functions 
from the framework of TDM and analog technology (Svrzić, 2019; Mitel 
Sweden AB, 2018a). 
176  
Components and architecture of the MiVoice MX-ONE 
Service Node communication systems 
Each MiVoice MX-ONE Service Node 6.0 switching system consists 
of the following three main components: 
• Telephony Server MX-ONE Service Node (formerly known as MX-
ONE Telephony Server), which has the task of taking care of signaling. It 
is actually call management software, based on the Novell SUSE® Linux 
Enterprise Server (SLES) version 11, with a 64-bit codeword 
architecture. It can be installed on the private IP network itself (or in the 
Esxi virtual environment on the cloud), as an instance of VMware Virtual 
Machine, or it can be installed on a standard physical, Intel-based server 
(i.e. any other server based on Intel technology). 
• Software or hardware Media Server MX-ONE Media Server, with 
DSP (Digital Signal Processor) resources  for managing tone detection, 
multiple conferencing and packet switching between different IP 
endpoints, i.e. between different protocols and codecs (SIP and H.323 
protocols; G.711 and G.729 codecs) in a homogeneous SIP 
environment, when direct media connection is not possible, i.e. when 
direct exchange of media streams between terminals is not performed. In 
installations with the SIP environment only, the Media Server has a load 
distribution/load balancing function and there is no need for dedicated 
Media Gateway hardware. For such installations, the Media Server can 
be located in the same Linux machine as the MX-ONE Service Node Call 
Server, which reduces the user trace, but can also be located on a 
separate server. 
• Media Gateway, which is not a mandatory component, but must 
exist as a supplement to the IP PINX variant in the PATN SAF. It is one 
or more hardware units, additionally installed in the IP PINX 
configuration, to provide everything that the Media Server does, but also 
to provide users with services on physical participant and transmission 
interfaces in TDM technology, and according to PINX, public networks 
and auxiliary devices. The Media Gateway also includes DSP resources 
for tone management, conferencing, packet switching to IP phones (SIP 
and H.323) and for media conversion between different protocols. Any 
combination of the Media Server and the Media Gateway (up to a 
maximum of 15 Media Gateways) can be connected to the same Server 
to call the MX-ONE Service Node. 
An overview of the manufacturer's (proprietary) system main 
components, terminal devices, applications and parts of the IP PINX MX-
ONE Service Node 6.0 IP monitoring and management system, as well 
as the systems and applications of other manufacturers that can be 
included in this system, is shown in Figure 1. It should be immediately 
pointed out (although part of it is not explicitly seen in the Figure) that the 
IP PINX itself, in addition to the above basic components, also includes 
hardware components for capacity building of various non-IP participants 
(analog and digital), components no IP and no ISDN trunks and power 
supply components. It also includes various terminal devices, which 
include all types of Mitel's participating telephones (IP, digital, video, 
mobile DECT, IP DECT, etc., up to analog), Legacy Terminals of earlier 
generations-LT and intermediary apparatus-AC (Attendant Clients). 
The necessary monitoring and management of this system is 
realized by connecting an external Directory Server which is not a Mitel 
product, and which then contains all the necessary dedicated, 
managerial service software (software packages: Provisioning Manager, 
Service Node Manager, Traffic Manager, etc.). To support the smooth 
operation of the IP PINX itself and the monitoring and management 
system, there are all the necessary software applications. Various 3rd 
Party devices, systems and other applications (from other manufacturers) 
can be connected to this IP PINX, such as VoIP Recording, SMS Server, 
Contact Center, Attendant, IPC, etc. (Mitel Sweden AB, 2018a) 
For IP PINX, applied in the PATN SAF, Media Gateway LIMs (Line 
Interface Modules) type MX-ONE Classic with an implemented MGU2 
board are implemented and housed in 19 '' LIM cabinets type LBP22. In 
the basic variant (with one MGU2 board) Media Gateway LIM supports 
up to 4 interfaces of the ISDN/PRA E1 or T1 type, analog and digital 
extensions, mobile DECT extensions, IP extensions (with H.323 and SIP, 
including IP DECT and WiFi), IP networking (with H.323 and SIP) as well 
as Q-SIG networking.

Basic traffic characteristics and components of the IP PINX system 
MX-ONE Service Node 6.0 
Native support for IPv6 addressing 
Regarding the MX-ONE 6.0 version, in addition to (earlier) IPv4, this 
switching system also supports new IPv6 addressing. The MX-ONE 
Service Node call server and Gateway components can operate as a 
native IPv6 network, in accordance with IETF Recommendation RFC 
2460 (Deering & Hinden, 1998). It is assumed that the HV platform and 
OS software can work using IPv4/IPv6 "dual stack" interfaces for the IP 
network. Alternatives are: IPv4/IPv6 “dual stack” or just IPv4. From a 
signaling and media perspective, the software components of the MX-
ONE elements (Call Manager and Media Gateways) can be configured to 
perform and share standard IPv6 addressing. An IPv4/IPv6 "dual stack" 
is installed for Inter-server communication, but only IPv6 is used 
regularly. In fact, the entire system (all servers) must use the same IP 
version of addressing. 
IPv6 and IPv4 addressing are supported for SIP terminals, clients 
and trunks. According to H.323 terminals, H.323 client and H.323 trunk, 
only IPv4 addressing system is supported. If one terminal only supports 
IPv4 and the other terminal only supports IPv6, the call between these 
two terminals will only be possible with a gateway. The MGU2 and the 
Media Server support both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, but, in cases 
where security (signal encryption) is not used, only the IPv6 addressing 
variant is used for the MGU2. (Mitel Sweden AB, 2018a) 
VoIP protection interfaces, protocols, QoS and telephone 
applications 
The software performs call management functions and has complete 
control over all ongoing calls as well as resources in the Media Gateway. 
The following protocols and interfaces are available for the external 
connection of MX-ONE Service Node 6.0, both to systems and 
applications of the same manufacturer and to systems and applications 
of other manufacturers ("Third Party"): 
• Private networking via SIP trunks as well as via H.323 trunks, 
where ISDN Q-SIG or proprietary ISDN signaling is transmitted. 
• Private networking via E1 (30B + D) and T1 (23B + D) trunks, via 
ISDN Q-SIG transmission, where T1 is used only in the MGU2. 
• Private networking via ISDN trunks E1 and T1, using proprietary 
signaling. 
• Private networking via MFC signaling transmission. 
• Private networking via signaling transmission via CAS (Chanel 
Asotieitid Signalling). 
182  
• Private networking via DASS2 signaling transmission. 
• Private networking via DPNSS (Digital Private Network System 
Signaling) and CAS transmission via E1 and T1 trunks. 
• Public SIP trunk (with different network operator profiles). 
• Public ISDN PRA via E1 and T1 and ISDN BRI (2B + D). (Mitel 
Sweden AB, 2018a) 
When it comes to the quality of service in VoIP, i.e. quality of service 
- QoS (Quality Of Service), it can be registered upon a call, as follows: 
delay, jitter, codec used and packet loss rate can be monitored and 
recorded. The data can be displayed in the Service Node Manage” or via 
the CIL (Command Line Interface) call log output information. 
When it comes to VoIP protection and security, the MX-ONE Service 
Node supports the use of the SRTP (Security Real-time Transport 
Protocol), as recommended by IETF RFC 3711 (Baugher et al, 2004). 
The MX-ONE Service Node also supports TLS (Transport Layared 
Security), as recommended by IETF RFC 4346/5246 (Dierks & Rescorla, 
2006; Dierks & Rescorla, 2008), which provides secure access to IP 
phones and web services and secure signaling between IP phones and 
the MX-ONE Service Node. (Mitel Sweden AB, 2018a) 
It is quite understandable that the SAF is paying more and more 
attention to the security aspects of the IP telephony infrastructure, which 
is also characteristic of the civil sector, where it is taken care of by 
corporate information directors (CIOs), many IT administrators and users 
themselves. Voice over IP traffic (signal and media) must be protected 
from possible numerous attacks. For example: media streams are 
protected from eavesdropping and intrusion, and signaling from 
modifications. For this reason, the PATN SAF specifically performs group 
crypto protection on IP/SIP trunks, which is necessary in order to 
professionally protect the signaling of VoIP messages and the content of 
media streams. Regardless of the aforementioned, the MX-ONE Service 
Node 6.0 system by default supports the following security measures that 
can be applied in practice: 
• Use secured RTP (i.e. SRTP) to protect media streams. MX-ONE 
supports the use of SRTP to encrypt media streams in IP phones as well 
as in MGU2, 
• Use Transport Layer Security to protect signal messages. In doing 
so, TLS guarantees the privacy of signaling even when SRTP keys are 
exchanged between parties, and 
• Support a number of flexible security “policies”, i.e. support 
environments with different security requirements. If extensions are 
allowed, then the main principle for security policy is guidance: whether 
these extensions must be registered in the system or not. After the 
registration of the realized extension, in terms of security, calls to any 
other party are allowed. SIP terminals must be authenticated using HTTP 
digest authentication. If the user is assigned a PIN code, authentication 
will be performed together with the SIP dialog, and from the SIP 
framework requires "INVITE". MX-ONE servers "spin" on operating 
systems that are highly capable of successfully resisting the most 
common network attacks. In that sense, recognized endangered services 
are immediately turned off, and the integrity of the files is periodically 
checked. In addition, clients are advised to implement security "policies" 
that cover the management of "patches" and antivirus software 
"updates". 
To overcome the separation of VLANs, server "farms" need to be 
protected by "fire walls" and IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems), which 
can block attacks. All control interfaces to MX-ONE servers can be run 
via secure protocols, such as SSH and HTTPS. Management and access 
operations of such interfaces are logged to have maximum control in the 
system. Users and system administrators must always authenticate 
themselves before obtaining permission to access the system. In 
addition, the access control mechanism allows different levels of privilege 
roles to be assigned to both users and system administrators. With MX-
ONE 6.0, VoIP security keys have been modified to comply with EU 
legislation 388/2012 (formerly 1232/2011). The VoIP security key is only 
allowed to work in one system installation. (Mitel Sweden AB, 2018a) 
Media Server system component on the ASU-E board 
From the aspect of the problem of IP PINX networking type MX-ONE 
Service Node 6.0 and the application of the Q-SIG tunneling procedure 
on the part of the central IP network (Core network) from the PTIS SAF, 
the system components: Media Server (MX-ONE Media Server variants) 
and the Hardware Media Gateway on the MGU2 board are of certain 
interest. 
The Media Server Unit MX-ONE Media Server has a Novells 
SUSE® Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) version 11 operating system, 
with a 64-bit architecture. In principle, this variant of the Media Server 
unit can be implemented in several variants, but the IP PINX MX-ONE 
Service Node 6.0 in the PATN SAF uses a variant of the ASU-E Media 
Server board. 
The applied variant of the Media Server board type ASU-E is 
characterized by improved performance and is based on the COMXpress 
184  
standard. The ASU-E server board is included in the configuration of 
LIMs of the MX-ONE Classic type, in variants with service of one or more 
Media Gateways. It is the latest server board (which has 16 GB of RAM), 
so in connection with that, there is a novelty in the IP PINX MX-ONE 
Service Node 6.0: 
• 64 bit OS (SLES11) and also natural n + 1 redundancy (network 
redundancy is not necessary; "Split brain" automatic recovery; controlled 
return and transition; clusters can be added, removed or reconfigured in 
the system), 
• Support for IPv6 addressing, so all components (Media Server and 
MGW) must be either IPv4 or IPv6 compatible; support for SIP trunks 
and SIP extensions; Dual stack is provided; IPv4 translations from/to 
IPv6 must be performed via MGW, 
• Media Server enhancements, which include a mix of Media 
Servers and MGUs, based on a maximum of 15 MGW per server; 
increased capacity of 2,000 RTP resources; ~ 50,000 users without using 
MGW for G.729 Codec (1/10 capacity), 
• “Ring groups” that include new items in “Hunt groups” 
(simultaneous ringing permission for up to 16 users - except DECT); 
RVA, diversions; Ring and Hunt groups, individual log-in / out; new 
procedures for "log-on / out" of individual groups, 
• Support for CAS extensions on MGU2, 
• Support for CAS trunk signaling, and 
• VMware certified ASU. (Svrzić, 2019; Mitel Sweden AB, 2018b) 
Media Gateway system component on the MGU2 board 
The Media Gateway board MGU2 is responsible for reconciling the 
IP and TDM environment in the IP PINX MX-ONE Service Node 6.0, with 
its specific position in the 7U cabinet, LIM type LBP22, which in practice 
is recognized by a special connector , as shown in Figure 4. 
The main functions of the MGU2 board are as follows: 
• Mediate in all communications to the MX-ONE Service Node, 
• Have interfaces for digital ISDN / PRA trunks E1 / T1, 
• Provide RTP / SRTP, DTMF detection, DTMF tones and facsimile 
tones over RTP and removes jitter on RTP, and echo in VoIP 
communication, 
• Provide T.30 G3 fax transmission using Protocol T.38, 
• Realize the reception and sending of DTMF codes for mobile 
extensions, 
• Realize the sending of tones in accordance with the standards of 
particular countries, 
• Provide a conference, 
• Provide greeting messages, and 
• Provide network redundancy. 
• Provides external alarms.

The layout of the front panel of the Media Gateway MGU2 and an 
overview of the elements on it are shown in Figure 5. 
Also, inside (on the board itself), there is a V24 interface for 
accessing the board, while on the back of the board there is a Back plane 
interface that can communicate with 16 position-boards. The displayed 
LED indication, on the front side of the MGU2 board, indicates the 
operational states in the operation of the board via visualization, as 
follows: 
• Blinking red - the panel is in “boot mode”, 
• Solid red - the board is not active, 
• Solid green - the board is registered to MX-ONE as well as its 
communication ports, and 
186  
• Flashing green - active board and STCP packets are sent from 
MX-ONE to MGU2. (Svrzić, 2019; Mitel Sweden AB, 2017)

MGU2 setting 
When initializing the MGU2 board, of course for the role of the Media 
Gateway in the IP PINX system MX-ONE Service Node 6.0, software 
settings are performed using the following commands: 
• "setpar eth0_ip ip-address/netmask" - address 
media_gateway_config, 
• "setpar eth2_ip ip-address/netmask" - address 
media_gateway_interface, 
• "setpar def_route ip-address" - the default Gateway address, 
• “setpar nfs_server ip-address” - MX-ONE address, 
• "dispar all" - check parameters, 
• "savepar" - save parameters, and 
• "restart" - restart. 
Note that in terms of the application of command syntax, in MX-ONE 
Service Node 6.0 in CIL, the syntax of MML commands for TDM is 
retained, as well as the added syntax of new UNIX commands for the IP 
(these commands have a record in Linux). (Svrzić, 2019; Mitel Sweden 
AB, 2017) 
Reporting the MGW Signaling Interface 
The command that defines the applied signaling of the MGU2 Media 
Gatewey and defines the Signaling interface is:  
“media_gateway_config-i-m1A-mgw-type MGU-cidr 
192.168.5.56-default gateway 192.168.5.1”, where the most important 
parameters are: 
• -cidr - address of the interface with the network mask in the format 
X.X.X.X / X, 
• -default-gateway - gateway address, 
• -ip-configuration-mode (static, dhcp, slaac), 
• -l - number of sheets, 
• -link-mode - interface speed, 
• -media-gateway - number of lim and gateway; format: LG, L = 1-
124, G = A-O, and 
• -mgw-type - type mgw (lsu, mgu). (Svrzić, 2019; Mitel Sweden AB, 
2017) 
Reporting the MGW RTP interface  
The command that defines the RTP data for media streams in the 
MGU2 Media Gateway and defines the Signaling Interface is:  
"media_gateway_interface-i-media-gateway 1A-cidr 
192.168.5.55-default gateway 192.168.5.1", and the parameters are 
exactly the same, as well as when registering the Signaling Interface, 
with the following two parameters: 
• -port-start and 
• -port-stop, which defines the range of ports for the media. (Svrzić, 
2019; Mitel Sweden AB, 2017) 
MGW information 
The command that prints MGW data is: “media_gateway_info”, and 
the important parameters are: 
• -attrib - Feature name, 
• -boo - Bool value, 
• -mgw-name - Resource instance, 
• -print - Read general Media gateway information, 
• -set - Set data in the resource name,  
• -string - String value, and 
• - Other parameters used to set MGU2. (Svrzić, 2019; Mitel Sweden 
AB, 2017) 
SIP trunking and other features of a modern private 
automatic telephone network 
The IP PINX MX-ONE Service Node 6.0 is certified for a large 
number of SIP network providers and complies with the SIP Connect 1.1 
188  
standard. The MX-ONE SIP trunking interface is also the basis for 
integration with "third party" systems, such as Microsoft Linc 2013/Skipe-
for-Business, IBM Sametime SUT and other platforms to enable 
"federation" between different communication platforms (Mitel Sweden 
AB, 2018a). 
The PINX type MX-ONE Service Node 6.0 can be connected to a 
private network with other such MX-ONE systems or Mitel's TSW/MD110 
systems, as well as with switching systems from other manufacturers. In 
order to use network services between all participants in such a private 
network, it must be homogeneous, in terms of the system of applied 
standardized signaling. This means that trunks to connect telephone 
exchanges must use the same standardized signaling system, since in 
the network scenario of switching from one signaling system to another, 
network services are not supported on the Gateway. Private networks in 
which trunk connections use ISDN, SIP and H.323 signaling systems are 
considered homogeneous networks (in terms of signaling). Figure 6 
shows the basic scenario of the PINX connection in a modern PISN of a 
functional user, which can be analogously copied for use in the PATN 
SAF, provided that the shown IP network Intranet WAN is understood as 
an existing IP network SAF (Intranet).  
Figure 6 – Principle of the organization of homogeneous PATN with the switching 
systems Mitel MX-ONE, Mitel TSW/MD110 and those of other manufacturers (Mitel 
Sweden AB, 2018a) 
Рис. 6 – Принцип организации однородного PATN с коммутационными системами

Слика 6 – Принцип организације хомогене ПАТлМр са комутационим системима 
Mitel „MX-ONE”, Mitel „TSW / MD110”  и других произвођача (Mitel Sweden AB, 
2018a)   
The figure shows that switching systems 1 to 4, in fact IP PINX of 
the same manufacturer, are interconnected via the IP network with SIP 
(and additional proprietary signaling), while switching systems 5 and 6 
are ISDN PINX (possibly another manufacturer), connected to the 
network via transit IP PINX 4 using ISDN Q-SIG (Q-signaling), via 
transmission systems using TDM. In such an ATN organization, all 
switching systems shown, i.e. IP PINX and ISDN PINX, can have their 
own incoming and outgoing external trunks for connection to the PSTN 
(Public Automatic Switched Telephone Network). 
The IP PINX MX-ONE Service Node 6.0 supports a number of 
shared user services and ANFs (Additional Network Functions). Typical 
customer services and network features are: “Call Diversion”, “Call 
Back”, “Call Intrusion”, “Call Waiting”, and “Bypass Diversion” 
(overcoming redirects). In order for the mentioned customer services and 
ANFs to be fully used throughout the entire private automatic telephone 
network, it is necessary that there exist a "powerful" signaling system in 
that network, which can transmit all the necessary signaling information. 
(Svrzić, 2019) (Mitel Sweden AB, 2018a). There are two groups of 
common network characteristics, i.e. system functions and customer 
services (which include basic and additional services). System functions 
are those used to switch and route calls in the network, in a controlled 
and fast way to the called destinations. The user can only request or 
influence user services, while he cannot exert any influence on system 
functions. 
In addition to the above, the following interesting features are 
supported within this type of PINX: "Customer Group", "Hospitality", 
"VoIP Recording", "Recorded Voice Announcement", "Blasklisting Of 
Calling Public Subscribers", "Streaming On Idle Extension", some of 
which could be applicable in the PATN SAF. (Svrzić, 2019; Mitel Sweden 
AB, 2018a) 
Description of the realized software preparation 
procedures for practical application of Q-SIG tunneling 
solution on the part of the PATN SAF 
The tunneling of Q-signaling through IP proxy using the SIP is 
practically realized on one part of the PATN SAF, where the 
interconnection between two participating transit IP PINX type Mitel MX-
ONE Service Node 6.0, is realized by a transmission beam of 30 IP 
trunks, and via a connection path organized with a capacity of 10/100 
Mb/s Ethernet. The participating end PINXs from the corresponding ISDN 
190  
parts of the PISN SAF are connected to both transit IP PINX, via the 
transmission beams of 30 TDM trunks each (with E1/ISDN PRI) and with 
the application of Network Signaling type Q-SIG. In connection with such 
a new situation in the PATN SAF, the necessary software interventions 
(for local resources on the IP PINX itself, and for network resources) 
were performed on both respective transit IP PINX, necessary to adapt 
user and network traffic data to the new situation, which was created by 
introducing a new route and establishing an IP/SIP transmission beam on 
it. (Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 2019a) 
Numbering plan 
The first, and very important, step in defining user data was to 
supplement the existing Numbering Plan (additional configuration). 
Therefore, it was very important to determine the parameters for the 
destination of the newly established route and direct the relevant external 
destinations from the Numbering Plan to it. The commands that define 
the numbering plan and read the entered data are: “number_initiate” 
and “number_end_number_print”. 
Common categories 
The next step was to define the amendments to the Common 
Categories, which determine the privileges in the process of making a 
basic call and user and network services over the newly established 
route. In this regard, we note that the only some categories of locals have 
the right of access to external destinations; that the length of dialing digits 
varies from category to category, etc. In doing so, we distinguish two 
types of Common Categories: for IP extensions and for analog/digital 
extensions, which are defined through the CIL interface with different 
commands. Common categories of IP extensions are defined with the 
command "Extension_profile", while Common categories of analog and 
digital extensions are defined through the MML commands, with the 
command "EXCCS". 
Description of the SIP route definition 
To administer specific data about the new route with SIP trunks, the 
command: "sip_route" was used. This specific data is used as a 
supplement, in addition to the data for defining traditional ISDN routes. 
Namely, when defining a new SIP trunk, the command "sip_route" is 
used first, and then the so-called "RO" commands: "ROCAI", "RODAI" 
and "ROEQI". In this case, if necessary, changes in the data to be 
created with the piece: "sip_route", can be made without removing the 
"RO" data. Therefore, in the given case, the initialization of the new SIP 
route took place in 5 steps. 
Functioning related to the “sip_route” command 
As explained, when the “sip_route” command is used, then the new 
data is used in addition to the traditional “RO” route data. So, the 
command "sip_route" must be used first, then "ROCAI", "RODAI" and 
"ROEQI". Of course, SIP route data must be present before using the 
“ROEQI” command. Note that the SIP routes can also be configured to 
only register subscribers in the remote system, without traffic 
configuration. In the command "sip_route", to bind external to internal 
numbers, together with the command to convert 
"number_conversion_initiate", the commands are used: "RODDI: ADC 
=", "LCDDI: BTON =", with parameters "uristringN" and "fromuriN" (with 
value N =: 0-7). (Svrzić, 2019; Mitel Sweden AB, 2017) 
Appearance of the requested printout to check the set 
parameters of the initiated SIP route 
In order to check the correctness and comprehensiveness of the set 
parameters of the new SIP route, specific commands are used to print 
the "RO" and "sip_route" parameters. In the practice of the PATN SAF, 
it could be clearly seen that the default set of parameters, specific to the 
“sip_route” command, is much richer than it was needed for a concrete 
solution of establishing a new SIP route. Namely, many parameters are 
irrelevant for a specific case, so they are without set values. (Svrzić, 
2019; Svrzić et al, 2019a) 
Description of the realized connection of the end 
ISDN PINX, through tunneling Q-SIG via IP/SIP in the 
PATN SAF 
The scenario for connecting participants from the final ISDN PINX 
(located on TKC1 and TKC4), realized by applying the Q-SIG tunneling 
procedure via IP/SIP on the part of the connecting road between transit 
IP PINX (located on TKC2 and TKC3), in the Private Automatic 
Telephone Network SAF, is shown in Figure 7 (Svrzić, 2019) (Svrzić et 
al, 2019a). This situation, which arose on the Core part of the PATN 
SAF, completely coincides with the situation shown on the standardized 
PISN model from Figure 4 from the literature: (Ecma International, 2008) 
and Figure 1 from the literature: (Svrzić et al, 2019a). 
192  
In this way, the Q-SIG call initiated by the digital participant "A", 
connected to the participant board ELU-28 end ISDN PINX, numbering 
"380-xxx" with TKC1, first uses Q-signaling and voice transmission to the 
2 Mbit/s E1 transmission beam according to the transit IP PINX with 
TKC2, to which the specified ISDN PINX is connected, via the E1 
connection on the transmission board TLU-76 and via the transmission 
system ODS 2.5 Gb/s.  
The Q-SIG call initiated by this transmission system comes to the 
transit IP PINX, as it is brought from its E1 port to the 2 Mb/s E1 interface 
port of its Media Gateway on the MGU2 board (plays the role of the 
Inbound Gateway). On the transit IP PINX, the call is processed in 
cooperation with the Media Server on the ASU-E board, in terms of 
encapsulating incoming Q-SIG messages (for signaling) and establishing 
media streams (for speech) within the SIP dialogue (TCP for Q-signaling 
and UDP for media streams). By applying the Q-SIG and media tunneling 
process by voice transmission within the SIP, the call over 100 Mb/s IP 
Switch and 100 Mb/s Ethernet port ODS 2.5 Gb/s crosses over the 
proprietary IP network with the SIP to the second transit IP PINX with 
TKC3. With a 100 Mb/s Ethernet port ODS 2.5 Gb/s and via the IP 
Switch, the call comes to the MGU2 board and the transit IP PINX, i.e. to 
its Media Gateway (plays the role of the Exit Gateway). 
The cooperation between the Media Gateway and the Media Server 
translates encapsulated Q-SIG messages and UDP media streams from 
the SIP dialog box into the original Q-SIG processions and the original 
speech signal in the ISDN format. With a 2Mb / s E1 interface on the 
MGU2, which is connected to the E1 port of the 2.5 Gb / s ODS 
transmission system, the Q-SIG call comes to the final ISDN PINX with 
TKC4. Namely, from the E1 connection of ODS 2.5 Gb / s, the call comes 
to the transmission board TLU-76, and through local switching ends at 
the participant "B" connected to the board of digital participants ELU-28, 
this ultimate ISDN PINX with the numbering "350 -xxx ” which uses Q-
SIG on the transmission beam to connect to the transit IP PINX with 
TKC3. (Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 2019a) 
Figure 7 – Scenario of tunneling Q-SIG over the proprietary IP network with the SIP in the 
PATN SAF (Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 2019a) 
Рис. 7 – Сценарий туннелирования Q-SIG по проприетарной IP-сети с SIP в PATN

ВС (Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 2019a) 
194  
The realized solution has achieved that, in the PATN SAF, in terms 
of transmission of basic and additional user services and all network 
services (as well as special Mitel "proprietary" services), there are no 
restrictions in terms of either compatibility of Inbound and Outbound 
Gateways or Q -SIG capabilities and equivalents of the SIP IP network, 
and there is no loss of parts of Q-SIG in the presented scenario of 
network "end-to-end" connection. Namely, for  Q-SIG tunneling within the 
SIP, the necessary inter-PINX TCP connection between two Media 
Gateways from the transit IP PINX with TKC2 and TKC3 is provided via 
the proprietary IP network. Then the tunnel, provided by the SIP for the 
transmission of signaling Q-SIG messages via the TCP, acts as a DQ 
signaling channel. At the same time, within the SIP established, UDP 
media streams function as UQ-channels for the transmission of user 
information (voice, modem information, fax per t.38, data and system 
messages). (Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 2019a; Svrzić et al, 2021 – Figure 
On the newly established 30-channel SIP transmission beam, the 
external group protection of information (ZI) was realized regarding 
tunnel-transmitted signaling criteria from the Q-SIG framework, as well as 
all user information transmitted through media streams. For this purpose, 
two types of devices for group crypto protection (GCP) of transmitted 
information were used: 
1) For IP/SIP packet transmission, at the level of 10/100 Mb/s Base-
Tx Ethernet which are mounted on both sides of the transmission SIP 
beam, i.e. of TKC2 and TKC3, and 
2) For 2 Mb/s E1 transmission of voice circuits which are mounted 
on both sides of the transmission ISDN beams, i.e. on TKC1-TKC2 and 
TKC3-TKC4. 
In this way, the necessary continuity of professional information 
protection was achieved along the entire connection path from the ISDN 
PINX "380-xxx" with TKC1, through the transit IP PINX "370-xxx" and 
"360-xxx" with TKC2 and TKC3, to ISDN PINX " 350-xxx ”with TKC4. 
The presented transmission network transmission systems (IVN) are 
IRITEL's Optical Digital Transmission Systems type ODS 2.5 Gb/s, for 
operation via optical media with applied SDH technology and digital 
transmission hierarchy. On the participant side, they are configured 
according to the principle of flexible multiplexers, based on the specific 
needs of users for capacities of 2 Mb/s E1 and 10/100 Mb/s Base-Tx 
Ethernet connecting paths, of each of TKC where they are mounted (for 
connecting telephone exchanges and others functions). As it can be seen 
from Figure 7, the capacity of 100 Mbit/s Base-Tx Ethernet ports was 
used to interconnect the transit IP PINX, with ODS 2.5 Gb/s, while the 
capacities of E1 ports 2 Mb/s were used to connect the ISDN PINX. 
(Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 2019a) 
Implementation of the parameters for jitter impact 
reduction  and echo cancellation 
During the testing of the implemented solution in the PATN SAF, it 
was noticed that there were no major problems with the set "RO" and 
"sip_route" parameters, i.e. that 
they are professionally set up and that they generally form a realistic 
backbone for the successful implementation of communications through 
the network as a whole. The second situation arose with the appearance 
of jitter on the processions of the RTP packets and echo on the VoIP 
communication channels, which appeared in the network from the very 
beginning, so activities had to be taken to reduce the impact of jitter and 
suppress echoes in order to maintain the quality of audio speech 
transmission (Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 2019a; Svrzić et al, 2019b). 
There are three basic components on the MGU2 (Media Gateway 
Unit) boards of the implemented Media Gateways of both transit IP PINX 
type MX-ONE Service Node 6.0: 
• TDM Switch, with a switching matrix type T-S-T (Time-Space-
Time) 2048 x 64 kb/s, 
• Ethernet (Layer 2) LAN, with two 10/100/1000 Base-Tx 
connections, and 
• Media Stream Processor (MSP) for VoIP phone applications and 
DSP oriented functions, related to the MGU2 (such as VoIP, T.38 and 
DTMF receivers). 
This allows Ethernet signaling packets, such as Non-RTP (say from 
the TCP), to be routed to the DP (Device Processor) via Switch Layer 2, 
while Ethernet packets to VoIP, such as the RTP, are routed to the same 
DP in the Media Steam Processor. (Svrzić, 2019; Mitel Sweden AB, 
2017). 
On the newly established SIP route between the transit IP PINX (on 
TKC2 and TKC3), with the TCP protocols for signaling and UDP/RTP for 
media streams, the network operation was tested in terms of checking 
the quality of realized VoIP channels, primarily in terms of real presence 
of jitter on the RTP packets, as well as echoes in speech transmission. 
The essence was to check, for the first time applied (found), the 
compromise values of the relevant parameters for reducing the impact of 
jitter and suppressing the existing echo. Due to the fact that in a given 
196  
situation, "circuit-switched" calls can sometimes pass through certain 
VoIP channels (e.g. between two analog phones via two different 
Gateweys), which then leads to a new delay of about 100 ms, this also 
had to be taken into account during the testing. (Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et 
al, 2019b) 
Reducing the impact of jitter 
The fact is that the RTP packets, transmitted over the IP network, 
can realistically have random variations of delay, can arrive out of order, 
and can be ejected from the procession (in case of excessive delay), 
which significantly reduces the quality of audio signals. To mitigate this 
negative impact, a JB (Jitter Buffer) circuit, installed on the MGU2 board, 
is used. In essence, improving the quality of the audio signal via the JB 
circuit can only be achieved by applying increased RTP packet delays, 
which then (when transmitting speech, and especially in combination with 
the echo at the far end) makes the echo more noticeable and disturbing. 
"Ad-hock" attempts to minimize this delay in noticeable echo situations 
can directly affect the degradation of speech quality (e.g. a situation with 
dropped packets can have a negative impact on the echo transmitter). 
In terms of the necessary adaptation of the participating IP PINX to 
the established jitter in the PATN SAF, the administration of their MGU2 
boards was realized with the use of the configuration parameters specially 
intended for adjusting the JB circuit to real network conditions. The JB 
circuit can be configured to operate in “adaptive” or “non-adaptive mode”, 
whereby its configuration is realized on one MGU2 board and affects all 
VoIP calls in it, including inter-GW media over the IP. (Mitel Sweden AB, 
2017). It turned out that the parametric configuration of the JB on the 
MGU2 of each of the participating IP PINX had to be a compromise 
between the required audio signal quality and the real increase in delay. 
By default for "typical networks", the JB in the MGU2 is set to work in the 
adaptive mode with pre-set, default parameter values in order to preserve 
the quality of the audio signal in relation to minimizing delays.  
However, for those networks that are very sensitive to signal delay, 
where the desired audio quality must be achieved by adjustment, and/or in 
the case of a very good network, reconfiguration must be considered, i.e. 
changing the default values of individual JB circuit parameters, which was 
also the case in the PATN SAF. Achieved in testing and acceptable in 
practice, the values of parameters for reducing the impact of jitter on RTP 
packets in the subject part of the PATN SAF, i.e. in the Core network,

During the testing, some experiences related to the "fight" against 
jitter were gained. Namely, the JB circuit is primarily intended for the 
adaptation of the MGU2 to the negative effects caused by the IP network 
itself, but it should always be borne in mind that VoIP endpoints (IP 
phones, gateways, IP proxies, etc.) are also parts of the network that can 
cause such influences.  
198  
Soft SIP clients without a dedicated HW timeslot number (e.g. Digital 
Signal Processor) in VoIP media will have significantly more jitter in 
outgoing RTP packets than it is the case with HW (Mitel Sweden AB, 
2017). This can then cause an increase in the time buffer in the JB, thus 
further increasing the total delay present. Therefore, in these and similar 
network scenarios, the delay over the MGU2 may be longer than 
expected, which should certainly be taken into account in further practice. 
(Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 2019b) 
Echo suppression 
The EC (Echo Canceler) is an integrated circuit on the MGU2 board 
designed to suppress the echo for calls over the IP-IP network with 
packet switching (VoIP). On the part of the circuit-switched network, echo 
is created when a part of the packet network transmitting signal is 
mapped to the return signal, i.e. the packet network receiving signal. 
Echo is usually caused by reflections at the transitions from 2-wire to 
4-wire transmission media (on the part of the circuit-switched network), 
but there is also acoustic echo in telephones. This then means that, in a 
real network, the EC setting must also be performed as a compromise. 
Namely, in VoIP calls, the occurrence of echo, in combination with delays 
caused by the IP network, is more disturbing than the echo in the TDM 
network with circuit switching, in which it may happen that there is no 
signal delay at all. In fact, on the packet-switched network side, the user 
perceives echo as the sum of echoes: from the source + from the 
suppression operation + from the packet network delays (includes: 
delays in Media Gateways during encoding/decoding and in the JB); 
delay in the transport part of the network during switching and in routers; 
delay at endpoints when encoding/decoding and in the JB). (Mitel 
Sweden AB, 2017; Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 2019b) 
 The MGU2 board, implemented in the IP PINX PATN SAF, supports 
two types of EC for VoIP Gateway calls: Standard EC and Dual Filter EC 
(DFEC). Care should be taken when choosing the type of echo 
suppressors and their settings, because in addition to affecting all VoIP 
calls established via this MGU2 board (including inter-GW media over the 
IP), they also have a large impact on the load of the MSP (Media Steam 
Processor). Of course, changing the EC type will immediately trigger a 
restart of the MCA (Media Control Application) as well as the MSP. The 
EC circuit also includes a NLP (Non-Linear Processor), i.e. a sub-
function that is able to "handle" the nonlinear part of the residual echo, 
and which the linear EC filter from the circuit cannot cancel. By default, 
the NLP is "disabled" during setup and is recommended to be "enabled" 
only when necessary. When the NLP is "enabled" and switched on, it 
generates CN (Comfort Noise) to the IP network. However, if for any 
reason it is not desirable, CN Generating can also be discontinued to 
produce silence (Mitel Sweden AB, 2017). 
With the selected "Standard EC", the length of the "Echo tail" can be 
adjusted from 8 to 128 ms, in steps of 8 ms, while the filter window is 
fixed at 24 ms. The advantage of "Sparse EC" is MIPS savings that 
correspond to higher channel density. "Standard EC" can be improved by 
"enabling EPCD (Echo Path Change Detection)", which then improves 
the adaptation of the filter window position. Setting up the EPCD will 
cause the MCA (Media Control Application) to be restarted (Mitel 
Sweden AB, 2017). 
With the selected "DFEC (Dual-Filter EC)" the length of the "Echo 
tail" can also be set from 8 to 128 ms, in steps of 8 ms, with the 
advantages of its application: avoidance of increased echo levels caused 
by filter divergence during bidirectional conversations and robust and fast 
detection of echo path changes. The main disadvantage is that DFEC 
reduces the density of DSP channels. (Mitel Sweden AB, 2017). 
During the testing, all the mentioned conditions were taken into 
account, so through several iterations, a configuration of parameters 
acceptable for practice was reached and their values are shown in the 
table in Figure 9 (Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 2019b). 
The experience gained shows that the following practical procedures 
are recommended for suppressing disturbing echo network VoIP traffic in 
the PATN SAF: 
1. The EC must be switched on thus enabling the Echo suppression 
function. The path of the media on which the transition from the IP to the 
TDM takes place (in the Media Gateway where calls are routed to/from 
the public ISDN trunk) is interesting. The “ClearChannel” parameter (i.e. 
ClearMode) must not be enabled, as this type of codec is not used for 
RTP. The RTP mode requires that the EC is always on. 
2. The NLP (Non Linear EC Processor) function must be enabled, as 
it eliminates nonlinear residual echo which cannot be solved by a linear 
plate filter. 
3. The "Dual-Filter EC" algorithm must be included, as it significantly 
improves echo suppression, but with caution, as DFE may have some 
negative impact on the capacity of the MGU2. 
4. If, after (re) configuration, echo reappears, you should check 
whether the new parameter configuration is fixed. For example: whether 
the parameters for "reload" are marked in the PINX itself, and whether a 
"back-up" of data has been made.

(Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 2019b)   
5. When, in practice, the echo duration is longer than the default 
value of 64 ms, the set EC cannot cancel it, so the default EC setting 
must be changed and adjusted to the actual echo duration. The duration 
of echo is the time that elapses from the moment when the speaker 
(medium) from the IP side sends a signal to the TDM side of the network 
to the moment when a part of that signal is returned (from the TDM 
network) to the speaker on the IP side (of course, attenuated). Changes 
to this parameter are made in steps of 8 ms, up to a maximum value of 
128 ms. 
6. If the duration is 64 ms <Echo <128 ms, then the appropriate 
length of the filter window can be set in the EC. Since the usual echo 
length is less than 10 ms, the length of the filter window should be set to 
24 ms. However, in exceptional situations, the duration of echo can be 
much longer, so this should be taken into account. Inadequately set 
duration of the filter window can have a certain negative impact on the 
capacity of the MGU2. (Svrzić, 2019; Svrzić et al, 2019b) 
Conclusion 
In the PATN SAF, the applied tunneling procedure for the 
transmission of encapsulated messages from Q-SIG, defined by the 
global ECMA-355 Standard, enabled calling between PINX, i.e. "islands" 
within PISN parts with circuit-switched circuits that use Q-signaling, 
although they are interconnected, in one part, by the transport IP network 
(which uses the SIP). At the same time, without any loss of Q-SIG 
functionality, the connection of participants with the specified end PINX is 
realized, by transiting through the IP PINX type Mitel MX-ONE Service 
Node 6.0, which are interconnected by Core network. This then 
concretely means that through the heterogeneous 
Telecommunication-information Network of the Serbian Armed 
Forces, according to the type of connection "from end to end", all basic 
and additional participation services and network functions of the ISDN 
are successfully transmitted. 
The realized solution, through the Intranet SAF, logically connected 
the mentioned transit IP PINX, i.e. helped establishing their mutual 
communication known as an Inter-PINX link, which contains a signal 
channel, known as a DQ-channel, and one or more channels for user 
information, known as UQ channels. Through the IPL, Mitel's IP PINX 
MX-ONE Service Node 6.0 successfully realizes one required TCP 
connection to support the DQ-channel and one pair of UDP media 
streams to support the UQ-channels, thanks to the use of mapping 
functions that take place in accordance with the global ECMA-336 
202  
Standard. Within the TCP connection, these IP PINXs transmit the 
encapsulated Q-SIG messages and Resource Control Information, which 
are necessary for the establishment of UDP streams, together on the DQ 
channel. 
The applied solution for tunneling Q-signaling via the transit IP PINX, 
through the organization of the SIP transmission beam through its own IP 
network (Intranet SAF) on the Core part of the Automatic Telephone 
Network SAF, represents a novelty in the organization and operation of 
the PTN SAF. In this way, the service life of the Q-SIG type network 
signaling system, proven in practice, has been extended in the PATN 
SAF. By tunneling Q-SIG and transmitting without degradation through 
the mentioned IP network with the SIP (encapsulation of Q-SIG 
messages into SIP dialogue messages), it was achieved that the PATN 
SAF does not violate the previously built PISN status, also in parts where 
its TDM/ISDN parts connect to IP Proxy. In addition, monitoring the 
operation in the network helped in gaining necessary experience related 
to quality software preparation and to defining traffic parameters of the 
SIP route as well as to the application of the necessary procedures to 
reduce the impact of jitter and suppress echoes, with a view to raising the 
quality of VoIP communications in the network. Equally important is the 
practical knowledge acquired during the physical realization of 
completing, connecting, adapting and adjusting the necessary 
participating hardware equipment (for switching, IP transmission, IP 
Switching, group cryptosecurity on IP and TDM trunks) and using its 
elements and details, which will, together with the knowledge acquired in 
the preparation of software and the selection of the traffic parameters of 
the SIP route, as well as in "fights" with jitter and echo, be applied to 
some of future TKC SAF, following the growth rate of the Core network. 
In addition to the above, in the PATN SAF, the new solution with the 
use of the IP network to connect the IP PINX using the Q-SIG tunneling 
procedures opens a whole range of other modern possibilities that will, 
with the undoubted growth of the Core network, contribute to the creation 
of a wide territorial platform and the implementation of multi-timed 
communications in real time, thus leading to the transition to UC (Unifed 
Communications).

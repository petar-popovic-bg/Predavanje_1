ACKNOWLEDGMENT: The work stemmed from the Model of Logistics Support Planning 
Support System (VA-TT-1 / 20-22) Project, Military Academy, University of Defense in

Abstract: 
Introduction/purpose: The paper presents a model of logistics support 
planning in the conditions of limited logistic resources based on the 
prioritization of customer requirements and resource allocation. Decision-
makers play a crucial role in the efficient and equitable allocation of 
resources as they prioritize among different user requirements.  
Methods: Requirement prioritization techniques that use nominal scale, 
ordinal scale, and ratio scale, and five methods for converting ranks into 
weighting coefficients have been applied to determine the degree of 
significance of user requirements. The Requirements triage method has 
been used for establishing relative priorities, while the heuristic algorithm 
determining the Kemeny median was used to consolidate individually 
ranked requests into a group rank. In order to balance opposing demands 
of users, consensus measures of group decision making were used. For 
obtaining an optimal planned solution of logistic support, the methods and 
techniques of resource allocation were applied.  
Results: A model for adaptive planning of logistics support in the 
conditions of limited resource capacities of the logistics system has been 
developed. 
Conclusion: The proposed model can be effectively applied in other areas 
of resource allocation. 
Keywords: logistics planning, requirement prioritization, triage, 
converting ranks into weights, resource allocation. 
Introduction  
Logistics support planning is a highly complex problem in a military 
organization. Research shows that even the most powerful armies in the 
world face numerous issues in planning the logistic support of military 
operations (McConnell & King, 2019). The most common problems faced 
by military logisticians are difficulties in forecasting, lengthy work, 
mismatch of requirements, and poor visibility of logistic resources.  
It is generally known that many logistics aspects (user requirements, 
resource capacities, operational environment, time, etc.) are stochastic, 
dynamic, and nonlinear, which causes high sensitivity of the logistic 
system (Milenkov et al, 2020).  
For military units to maintain the combat strength needed to conduct 
operations in the new environment, whether combat or 
humanitarian, research shows that armies will need to fundamentally 
improve their logistics models used in the previous period and conduct 
extensive logistics planning (Hurley & Coleman, 2018).  
During the logistics support planning process, logistics bodies have 
an essential role, first to understand and then to balance opposing 
requirements of users, and with their knowledge, competence, and ability 
to create an optimal Logistics Support Plan which will, in the observed 
planning period, ensure the best overall military organization 
performance with a limited resource capacity of the logistic system (Jia et 
al, 2020).  
All these limitations motivated the authors to explore the possibility 
of applying the allocation of limited resources to the existing logistics 
system and develop an awareness of the need to modernize the way of 
thinking, decision making, and reducing the stress of logistics organs due 
to increased outflow of staff. 
Whenever deadlines are short, resources are limited and user 
requirements exceed the resource capacities of the logistic system, it 
implies that some requirements would not be completely met. In that 
case, it is necessary to decide which requirements will be fully 
completed, which partially, and which will not be completed, i.e. it is 
essential to prioritize the requirements and allocate resources with which 
the conflicting user requirements will be met to a certain 
extent. Accordingly, priority prioritization and resource allocation are 
significant activities in logistics support planning.   
Determining the needs for ammunition (Zlatnik & Mares, 2020), fuel, 
spare parts, food and water items, determining the occurrence of failure 
on assets, as well as the place and time of service procedures, requires 
extensive calculations and forecasts. To take specific measures to meet 
these needs, logistics authorities must gain direct insight into the state of 
availability of resource capacities of the logistics network (no matter 
whether it is material stocks or maintenance capacities). These problems 
cannot be adequately solved without modern decision support tools that 
can predict rapid changes in logistic requirements and analyze the 
resource capacities of the logistic network (McConnell et al, 2021). Some 
of these tools, which can be found in the literature, belong to MCDM 
methods: MARCOS, CODAS, EDAS, VIKOR, MABAC, and many others 
(Li et al, 2020).  
MARCOS (Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to 
COmpromise Solution) considers an anti-ideal and ideal solution at the 
very beginning of the formation of an initial matrix, closer determination of 
utility degree concerning solutions, a proposal of a new way to determine 
utility functions, a possibility to consider a large set of criteria and 
alternatives while maintaining the stability of the method (Sarma et al, 
2020). 
CODAS stands for COmbinative Distance-based Assessment, and it is 
used to determine the desirability of an alternative. This method uses the 
Euclidean distance as the primary and the Taxicab (non-Euclidean) distance 
as the secondary measure, and these distances are calculated according to 
the negative-ideal point. The alternative which has greater distances is more 
desirable in the CODAS method.  
The desirability of alternatives in the Evaluation Based on Distance from 
Average Solution (EDAS) method is determined based on their distances 
from an average solution. Because the average solution is determined by the 
arithmetic mean in this method, the EDAS method can be efficient for solving 
stochastic problems. 
VIKOR (Multicriteria Optimization and Compromise Solution in 
Serbian) solves decision problems with conflicting and 
noncommensurable (different units) criteria. Assuming 
that compromise is acceptable for conflict resolution, the decision-maker 
wants a solution that is closest to the ideal one, and the alternatives are 
evaluated according to all established criteria. It ranks alternatives and 
determines the solution named compromise that is closest to the ideal. 
The MABAC (multi-attributive border approximation area comparison) 
model handles the complex and uncertain decision-making issues by 
computing the distance between each alternative and the bored 
approximation area (Pamučar & Savin, 2020).   
Based on all the above, the goal of this paper primarily indicates the 
growing need to develop the logistics planning process, and the final 
transition from traditional thinking to more modern, innovative solutions to 
keep pace with foreign armies. In practice, this would be reflected in a 
fast decision-making process using information systems based on 
modern resource allocation models to reduced logistics staff effort and 
shorten response time. 
The current process of manual logistic support planning requires a 
high level of resourcefulness, combinatorics, and calculations to perform 
all the defined tasks with the best possible results. Based on practical 
experience, the method of allocation of limited resources was applied in 
this paper as a starting point for the development of a simplified logistics 
support plan. Certainly, this paper should contribute to the development 
of logistics support and the planning process in the army in general, 
given that the existing literature does not recognize this way of solving 
the allocation of resources (Daoud et al, 2021). 
Nowadays, research shows that even in modern armies, logistics 
planners do not have adequate tools to help them provide quick answers 
to questions, especially in a time-limited expedition planning environment 
(Schwartz et al, 2019). Therefore, the development of more intelligent 
planning and analytics tools is enabling the military to expand logistics 
innovations further and improve the efficiency of the logistics system. 
Basic features of the logistics support planning 
The logistics support planning is a complex undertaking that requires 
good forecasting, logistics network optimization, and risk analysis in a 
highly uncertain environment (Rogers et al, 2018).  
The goal of the logistics support planning is to determine the optimal 
logistics resources, as well as the order, manner, and deadlines for 
performing logistics support tasks and elaboration of measures, based on 
the elaborated variant of using engaged forces, objective assessment of 
the situation, and accurate calculations and activities to increase the 
efficiency of the logistics system, its stability, and vitality.  
Logistics support planning is a segment of the operational planning 
process and represents a very dynamic process with a defined goal that 
takes place at a specific time. It requires a creative and organized action 
of the logistics management bodies which is a necessary condition for 
achieving a certain degree of organization in preparing executive logistic 
staff and their precise work plan. The action should be harmonized 
concerning the set goal, time, and space for the execution of tasks.  
In the last period, the countenance of modern military operations has 
changed radically, which has led to a change in the operational 
environment and the use of military forces. Modern operations are 
primarily reflected in the increasingly stringent and complex requirements 
of users in terms of speed, safety, quality, quantity, and diversity of 
providing the necessary resources. The emerging operational 
environment is changing rapidly and requires rapid responses, which has 
led to traditional military planning not offering good enough solutions.  
New approaches to military planning should be able to deal with 
emerging issues by providing solutions that are robust to deviations from 
ordinary circumstances and be easily adaptable to new information that 
becomes known during the execution of the plan, thus increasing 
effectiveness and efficiency in military operations (Zeimpekis et al, 
2015).  
Traditional planning seeks solutions that require minimal 
modifications of the plan during the execution phase. Such an approach 
to initial plan development may require relatively large calculations. On 
the other hand, agile planning requires quick solutions that allow a plan 
modification and re-planning to anticipate events and information during 
the execution phase (Zeimpekis et al, 2015).  
The basic elements considered in logistics support planning for a 
military operation, as complex actions of the project type, are user 
requirements viewed as activities to be serviced, time, resources, and 
costs.   
Resources are usually of limited capacity, which leads to the fact 
that user requests for a specific type of resource are more significant 
than the ability of the logistics system to fully meet all requests in one 
particular (given, planned) period of time. In that case, the process of 
planning the allocation of limited resources is very complex because the 
logistics authorities are faced with the problem of how to provide an 
effective, efficient and fair way to meet user requirements while obtaining 
the most significant global utility of the military system.  
Implementing an effective policy of planning and resource 
management in military logistics requires constant monitoring and a 
comprehensive analysis of the availability of actual and potential logistic 
resources. This enables the development of an optimal system of 
resource allocation among interested users, taking into account the 
introduction of modern technologies and energy savings (Kostiuchenko & 
Solomon, 2020).  
The approaches to solve the problem of the rational allocation of 
limited logistic resources, in the logistics planning process, depending on 
the policy of resource adjustment, can be classified as follows:  
- To firmly set a deadline, with a known scope and type of  
  requirements and engage resources sufficient to all user requirements  
  to be met. In this case, a cost minimization strategy is applied;  
- To find a solution for known available (limited) resources, with a  
  known scope and type of requirements, which will provide a  
  minimum extension of time to provide the necessary resources  
  and meet all user requirements. In this case, a time minimization  
  strategy is applied;  
- To select the type and scope of requirements that can be met, to  
  achieve maximum effects, for known available (limited) resources,  
 in a firmly set period of time. In this case, the strategy of maximizing  
 the global utility is applied, i.e. the rule of allocative or Pareto 
         efficiency.  
In the process of the logistics support planning, logistics staff should 
continuously observe, study and analyze user requirements in different 
ways and from different points of view, and generally have to make many 
decisions based on individual perception and experimentally chosen 
criteria, to respond to the requirements as rationally as possible to users 
with available resource capacities of the logistics system (Milenkov et al, 
2020).

The result of the planning process is the Logistics Support Plan, a 
document in which the planning actions are written towards the set 
goal. The development of the plan concretizes the goal and determines 
in more detail what needs to be done to reach the goal, having in mind 
the probable development of future events. The concretization of the goal 
includes answers to the questions: what needs to be done, who needs to 
do it, when it needs to be done, where it needs to be done, with what to 
do it (with what resources), and how to do it. It aso needs back-up 
solutions in the case the assumptions and limitations on which the plan 
change is based (Andrejić et al, 2004; Andrejić, 2001).  
The plan must be flexible enough to allow for changes and additions, 
thus expressing the continuity of the planning process. So, continuity of 
planning requires reviewing the goals and, if necessary, redefining them, 
i.e. revising the plan in certain time intervals. In general, the logistics 
support planning process includes the following steps:  
- Determining customer requirements, expressed through the

- Determining the available resource capacities of the logistics  
  system in the observed planning period; 
- Determining the deviation of the required and available  
  resource capacity;  
- Choice of policy to meet customer requirements;  
- Development of alternative planning solutions;  
- Selection of a planning solution from the set of acceptable 
  solutions; and 
- Concretization (detailed elaboration) of the selected planning  
  solution.  
These activities indicate that in the process of logistics support 
planning, it is necessary to apply adequate models for the allocation of 
limited logistic resources in accordance with the conflicting requirements 
of the users to achieve better global utility of military formation.  
It is obvious that solving the problem of allocating limited resources 
during the logistics support planning process requires the involvement of 
several stakeholders, which in organizational terms is a collective (group) 
way of decisions making. Therefore, it is imperative to adhere to certain 
principles, adopted priorities and present restrictions to mitigate the 
conflict of the user requirements and make the Logistics Support Plan as 
efficient as possible.  
Logistics support planning based on prioritization of 
requests and allocation of limited resources  
In the broader context of logistics support planning, the first 
important question that arises is what to allocate and to whom to allocate 
it, while the second question is how much to allocate. The answers to 
these questions are very complex and must be assessed against the 
higher goals of the military organization, especially when there are limited 
resource capacities of the logistics system. In this regard, the problem of 
resource allocation is an essential and challenging task in logistics 
support planning, where logistics resource capacities such as material 
resources, intangible items (e.g. services), and human resources are 
allocated in accordance with user requirements.  
In general, the problem of resource allocation is present in various 
fields and attracts the attention of many researchers and 
practitioners. Different approaches to resource allocation are presented 
in the literature, which is based on specialized mathematical models and 
algorithms (Luss, 2012). These models are used in many areas, such as 
industrial production management, communication, and computer 
networks, emergency services, health services, air traffic, allocation of 
water rights, environmental and military issues (Luss, 2012; Meran et al, 
2021; Skobelev, 2011; Hameed et al, 2016).  
The central question in resource allocation problems is how to 
optimize a goal based on certain criteria. In such problems, there are 
often contradictions and tensions in establishing a certain balance 
between user requirements because achieving one value can be 
detrimental to another. These problems are often modelled so that the 
immediate outcome of optimization is a Pareto set of sustainable 
solutions (Chevaleyre et al, 2006; Ogryczak et al, 2014).  
If there are conflicting goals among interested users, the Pareto set 
contains several solutions that represent different trade-offs in conflicts 
over resources. The basic goal of solving such problems is to choose the 
best compromise for a particular domain in which optimization is applied 
(Luss, 1999).  
Resource allocation is a problem of discrete optimization and 
belongs to the category of NP-heavy (non-deterministic polynomial-time 
hardness) problems. Finding solutions that meet all the limitations means 
searching for a vast space of possible solutions. Therefore, the 
application of advanced techniques that use different heuristics to narrow 
the search space allows us to find a solution that is close to optimal.  
The development of fully automated systems for solving allocation 
problems is often rejected in practice. The reason may be restrictions 
that are difficult to register fully, decision criteria difficult to 
determine, and end-users not usually being experts in using complex 
mathematical concepts such as large matrices of mathematical 
programming or weighting factors of multicriteria optimization.  
In the conditions of uncertainty, logistics staff in charge of logistics 
support planning often have incomplete, inaccurate, contradictory, 
insufficiently clear, and insufficiently reliable information on user 
requirements and available resource capacities of the logistics system, 
which complicates the process of determining the distribution of 
resources in the logistics system in accordance with customer 
requirements.  
In the case when resource capacities of the logistic system are 
insufficient to meet all user requirements, specific heuristic rules can 
provide great assistance to logistics authorities in choosing a policy to 
meet user requirements, such as:  
- Rule "First come, first served";  
- Rule "The most urgent request is served first";  
- Rule "The request whose realization lasts the shortest is served  
  first";  
- Rule "The nearest date is executed first" (request with the shortest  
  time - waiting period);  
- Rule "Priority of requests, i.e. ranking of requests according to the  
  degree of significance".  
Prioritization of requirements has proven in practice as an effective 
strategy in the allocation (distribution) of resources that facilitates the 
decision-making process and allows suppliers to efficiently and fairly 
provide resources to a larger number of users (Luss, 2012). 
Limited resource allocation model  
To solve the problem of the logistics support planning, it is 
necessary to know the requirements of users ( mi ,...,2,1= ) for a 
particular type of resource ( )
B , and, on the other hand, it is necessary 
to know the availability of required resource capacities of the logistic 
system ( )
for the observed planning period. 
The value ( )
B  represents the needs of the i-th user ( mi ,...,2,1= ) 
for the j-th type of resource ( )nj ,...,2,1= , i.e. 
 it represents 
the total required amount of the j-th type of resource of all m users. At the 
same time, the size ( )
R  represents the availability of the j-th type of 
resources in the observed planning period. 
Satisfaction of specific user requirements with the j-th type of 
available resources ( )
can be presented as follows: 
                                    (1) 
where: 
R  - the amount of the j-th type of resource with which it entirely (100%) 
meets specific user requirements ( )ki ,...,1= ,  
R  - the amount of the j-th type of resource with which specific i-th user 
requirements are partially met ( )lki ,...,1+= , 
R  - the missing amount of the j-th type of resource due to which the i-th 
user requirements are determined ( )mli ,...,1+=  unsatisfactory. 
Depending of resources availability, two basic planning categories 
can be applied: resource levelling and resource allocation. 
The problem of levelling resources arises in the case when there is a 
sufficient amount of available resources of the logistic system to meet all 
user requirements in the observed planning period entirely. Here, it is 
essential to fulfill the condition of timeliness of satisfying all user 
requests, which is achieved by determining the order of satisfying user 
requests for a specific type of resource. 
In this case, the needs of all users are fully met, and the solution to 
the problem of resource planning is unambiguous and comes down to 
the distribution of the size of available resources
R  of a series of 
quantities ( )
B , where the condition is satisfied: 
                                                      (2) 
The size 
R  represents the available amount of resources, i.e. 
rRR +=
, where the size
R  represents the number of resources that 
are allocated to user requirements, while 
r  represents the number of 
resources that remain after distribution, i.e. represents the excess 
resources for the observed planning period. 
The problem of resource allocation occurs when resources are 
limited, i.e. insufficient to meet all user needs in the observed planning 
period, which can be mathematically represented with the following 
expression: 
RBB =
                                        (3) 
In this case, there is a shortage of resources, which for the j-th type 
of resource is: 
RBR −=                (4) 
The size 
R  should be taken away from the users in some way to 
cover the existing lack of required resources. 
The solution to this problem comes down to allocating the available 
amount of the resources
R  to the order of new quantities 
b to satisfy 
the following condition: 
, respectively 
   (5) 
This can be done by shortening the required amount of resources to 
each user by the number of missing resources 
 , so that
represents the total amount of missing resources that could cover the 
resulting shortage or meet the condition: 
       (6) 
where: 
 - reduced amount of the j-th resource to the i-th user. 
Research on resource allocation problems shows that ranking user 
requests according to the degree of importance, seeking or sharing the 
same resource, is an important activity when deadlines are short and 
resources are limited (Lehtola et al, 2004). Requirements prioritization is 
the setting of ranks or ratings of importance to a set of requirements 
based on specific criteria and according to the viewpoints of various 
stakeholders (Moisiadis, 2002, Ogryczak et al, 2014). 
In addition, when ranking the requests, what is important is the 
method of determining the coefficient of the significance of the request 
concerning the obtained rank. 
From the set conditions and specific priority requests of the user 
for a specific type of resource, the coefficient of the significance of 
the request of the i-th user for the j-th type of resource can be determined
 ( )1,0
From the above conditions, the appropriate relative coefficient of the 
significance of satisfying the user's request for the j-th type of resource 
whose value is: 
     (7) 
where: 
B  - the size of the required j-th type of resources by the i-th user for the 
observed planning period, 
- the coefficient of the significance of the request of the i-th user for 
the j-th type of resource, and 
m  - number of users. 
In that case, the reduced amount of the j-th resource to the i-th user 
can be determined by the following relation: 
jijij
      (8) 
In this situation, the amount of the j-th resource allocated to the i-th 
user is: 
ijijij
Bb −=
                 (9) 
The assessment of meeting the requirements of the i-th user with 
the j-th type of resources after reducing the planned amount is 
determined by the coefficient of individual service of the user: 
=       (10) 
In this way, it is ensured that the coefficient of individual customer 
service
  is equal to the coefficient of the average service j  of all p  
 users ( )mp 0
with the same priority of satisfying the requirements 
with the j-th type of resource. 
In this case, the coefficient of average customer service with the 
same priority resource is: 
       (11) 
The procedure in this model of allocation of limited resources 
ensures that the Plan of allocation of limited (insufficient) resources is 
rational, fair, and correct for all users because all the set conditions are 
met. 
Requirements prioritization techniques 
One of the key problems of optimal allocation of limited resources is 
setting priorities to meet user needs. However, this problem can be 
overcome by using specific techniques, methods, and approaches of 
prioritization. 
Numerous user prioritization techniques have been presented in the 
literature, see (Vestola, 2010; Achimugu et al, 2014; Khan et al, 2015; 
Qaddoura et al, 2017; Hudaib et al, 2018; Olaronke et al, 2018).  
In general, request prioritization techniques can be divided in two 
categories. Techniques include requirement prioritization methods and 
requirements negotiation approaches (Olaronke et al, 2018). 
Request prioritization methods are classified into methods that use a 
nominal scale, ordinal scale, and ratio scale, while approaches to 
negotiating claims focus on assigning priority to meeting requirements 
through consensus of stakeholders. 
Nominal scale methods allow requests to be assigned to different 
priority groups, where all requests in one priority group are treated 
equally. Ordinal scale methods result in an orderly list, so it is possible to 
see which requirements are more important than the others, but not by 
how much, while relationship scale methods give a relative difference 
between requirements, i.e. they can quantify how much more important 
one request is than another. In addition to these methods, other methods 
are cited in the literature, such as Interval Scale, Hybridized Scale, and 
Machine Learning (Olaronke et al, 2018). 
Each of these methods and techniques is characterized by different 
challenges, as none can be considered the best given the problems that 
accompany them, such as reliability, consistency, consensus when 
multiple stakeholders are involved, as well as difficulties when there is a 
large number of requirements, etc. In addition, some take more time but 
give more accurate results (Zou et al, 2019).  
In practice, it becomes challenging for decision-makers to choose 
the correct method and technique when prioritizing requirements. In 
many cases, decision-makers are faced with the fact that not all 
requirements can be fully met due to limited resources and time. This 
means that it must be decided which of the requirements can be 
removed from the observed set of requirements and which requirements 
can be partially satisfied. 
However, the development of models based on hybrid approaches 
that include a combination of different methods and techniques, as well 
as reaching consensus among stakeholders, can be considered as 
promising models in decision-making when prioritizing customer 
satisfaction (Wei et al, 2021). 
The Requirements triage method is a handy tool for establishing 
relative priorities in the assessment of resources to meet user 
requirements, where requests are most often classified into three groups 
on a nominal scale, as follows:  
- High priority requirements (critical, fundamental), which must be  
  fully met;  
- Standard priority requirements (quite important), which can be  
  partially met; and 
- Low priority requirements (irrelevant, not mandatory), which do not  
  have to be met in the observed period. 
After the triage of requests, the next step is to rank those requests 
that can be partially met according to the degree of importance 
depending on their position on the ranking list. 
Let  nxxxX ,,, 21 =  be a set of predefined options (requirements), 
where ix  
represents the i-th requirements ( )ni ,,1= . Let 
dddD ,,,
=  be a set of decision-makers, where kd denotes the k-
th decision-maker ( )mk ,,1= . Each decision-maker Ddk  can 
express their preference information using different preference 
structures.  
The procedure of the rank selection process is given as follows: 
Step 1: Obtaining the individual preference vectors 
Let  k
rrrR ,,,
the individual ranking vector, where 
r represents the i-th rank of requirements ( )ni ,,1= , which is given by 
the decision-maker kd . 
Step 2: Obtaining the collective preference vectors 
After obtaining individual preference vectors by different decision-
makers, for calculating the collective preference vector 
rrrR ,,,
= , where ir  
represents the i-th rank of requirements 
( )ni ,,1= , in this paper, the heuristic algorithm of the median Kemenia 
is applied (Milićević & Milenkov, 2014). 
Step 3: Consensus reaching process 
A consensus-reaching process is a dynamic and iterative group-
discussion process that helps the decision-makers to bring their opinions 
closer before making a decision (Pérez, 2018 ). This process consists of 
several rounds where the decision-makers discuss and change their 
preferences according to the suggestions given by a moderator. Usually, 
the moderator is a person who does not participate in the discussion, but 
he or she helps the decision-makers to make their preferences closer to 
each other. The moderator's tasks are 1) computing the consensus 
measures, 2) checking the level of agreement, and 3) generating some 
advice for those decision-makers that should change their minds. 
To calculate the level of consensus, the ordinal consensus degree 
(OCD) measures is applied in this paper, The OCD is defined as the 
deviation between individual preference vectors and collective preference 
vectors (Dong & Zhang, 2014), as follows: 
( ) 
    (12) 
The ordinal consensus degree among all decision-makers is given 
as follows: 
  ( )
dddOCD
,,,    (13) 
If the ( ) 0,,, 21 =mdddOCD  , then all decision-makers have 
complete ordinal consensus with the collective option. Otherwise, the 
smaller  mdddOCD ,,, 21   value indicates the higher ordinal consensus 
level among  mddd ,,, 21  . 
When the level of consensus is not met, a feedback adjustment 
procedure is applied to improve the level of consensus among decision-
makers, which is repeated until a predetermined level of consensus is 
reached 
(Tang et al, 2021). 
Methods of converting ranks into weighting coefficients  
Ranking user requirements and then converting ranks into weights 
has certain advantages. The main advantage of this method of 
determining the significance of user requests is that it is much easier to 
rank user requests by applying specific methods of prioritization, and 
then based on the obtained unified list of n
prioritized (ranked) 
requirements, determine the weighting coefficients of the significance of 
the requirements by applying specific methods for converting ranks into 
weight values (Tufail et al, 2019). 
In the literature (Milićević & Milenkov, 2014; Alfares & Duffuaa, 
2016), several methods for determining the weight values of the 
coefficients based on their rank are presented. The following methods 
were used in this paper: 
1) Variable-slope linear (VSL) weights:  
75756.37
19514.3100 −
+−= r
  (14) 
2) Rank-sum (RS) weights:  
( ) nrnw
/1100 −+=
(15) 
3) Rank reciprocal (RR) weights:  
/100=
      
(16) 
4) Rank order centroid (ROC) weights: 
/1100
     (17) 
5) Geometric weights (GW): 
( ) 12
      
(18) 
where:  
wr - weight value of the coefficient of significance of the request,  
r - rank required, n - the total number of user requests. 
The weight values of the coefficient of the significance of the 
requirements obtained by these methods are in the range from 0 to 100. 
By additive normalization, these values are reduced to the interval 0-1. 
In this paper, the aggregation of the weight values of the coefficient 
is performed by arithmetic averaging of the obtained values using the 
above methods, with the following expression: 
      (19) 
where:  
q  - the number of methods applied, and  
nj ,,2,1 =
- the user request number. 
Application of the resource allocation model 
For the observed planning period, the requirements of 5 users who 
use the same resource of the logistics system were analyzed. 
The logistics support planning process was implemented through the 
following steps shown in Figure 2: 
Step 1: Determine user requirements for a particular type of 
resource 
After the analysis, the user requirements were grouped into ten 
homogeneous groups, with the total required capacity 7000=
B of 
resource units, as shown in Table 1. 
Table 1 –  Overview of the user requests for the same type of resource 
Tаблица 1 – Обзор запросов пользователей по одинаковому типу ресурса

Total 600 500 500 750 1000 600 1000 500 800 750 7000 
Step 2: Determining the available capacities of the logistics system 
for the required type of resources 
For the observed planning period, it was determined that the 
logistics system for the required type of resources has a capacity of 
5000=
units of measure. 
Step 3: Determining the deviation of the required (required) from the 
available resource capacity 
Given that the total required resource capacity of the user 
is 7000=
units of measure and that the logistics system has the 
resource capacity of 5000=
units of measure,  there is a shortage of 
resources in the system of
200050007000 =−=−=
RBR  units of 
measure. 
Step 4: Select a customer satisfaction policy. 
The choice of customer satisfaction policy plays a key role, given the 
present deficit of resource capacity of the logistics system. In this regard, 
the “Priority of Requirements” rule has proven in practice to be a very 
effective policy for the allocation of limited resources. 
In this paper, the technique of request triage was first applied, where 
after the analysis, it was decided which requirements will be fully 
satisfied, which partially, and which will not be served. After that, the 
technique of ranking the partially met requirements was applied to 
determine their degree of significance to achieve the greatest global 
usefulness of the system. 
Step 4.1: Application of the triage requirement technique 
By applying the request triage technique, the decision-makers 
decided that the requests of users B7, B8, and B9 were fully met, and the 
request of B10 was not met. It was also decided that other requirements 
would be partially met by all users.

K4 200 0 0 300 300 50 850 
K5 0 100 200 50 150 0 500 
Total
Following the request triage procedure, the total required resource 
capacity of the users is 3950=
B  units of measure, and the available 
resource capacity of the logistics system is now 2700=
units of 
measure. So, there is still a deficit of resources in the system, which now 
amounts to: 
125027003950 =−=−=
Step 4.2: Ranking the requests that are partially served 
In the process of determining the degree of significance of the 
requests that are partially served, five decision-makers participated in 
ranking the requests B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, and B6. 
Table 3 provides an overview of the ranked user requirements by 
the decision-makers.

DM5 2 1 3 5 4 6 
Step 4.3: Consolidate individually ranked requests into a group rank 
Consolidation of individually ranked requests by a group of decision-
makers into the final group order was done by applying the heuristic 
algorithm to determine the Kemeny median.  
After performing the procedure of binary relations between ranking 
pairs, the obtained elements of the loss matrix are shown in Table 4.

B5 10 10 10 6 0 4 
B6 10 10 10 10 6 0 
Table 5 shows the procedure for applying the Kemeny median 
algorithm to obtain the final group order of user requests in accordance 
with the degree of significance.

order

B4 34 22 12 4   
B5 42 30 20 10 4  
B6 26 36 26 16 6 0 
The final group rank of the requests is B2, B1, B3, B4, B5, and B6. 
Step 4.4: To calculate consensus levels 
By applying Eqs. (12) and Eqs. (13), the level of consensus is 
calculated, which is .08889.0=OCD  The obtained level of consensus is 
satisfactory, which means that the decision-makers do not need to adjust 
their preferences.  
Step 4.5: Determining the weight values of the coefficient of the 
significance of the requirements  
Table 6 shows the weight values of the coefficients of the 
significance of the requirements based on their rank, obtained by 
applying the method of converting the ranks into weight values.

Wj 0.2763 0.2181 0.1714 0.1375 0.1101 0.0866 
Step 5: Development of alternative planning solutions 
By applying the model, alternative solutions for selecting the optimal 
Logistic Support Plan have been developed, depending on the weight 
values of the coefficients of the significance of the requirements
which are shown in Table 7. 
From Table 7, it can be seen that the difference between the 
maximum and minimum values of the percentage of customer service in 
the VLS method is 18.80, in the RS method 55.08, In the RR method 
41.26, in the ROC method 69.33, while in the GW method it is 46.26. 
The difference between the maximum and minimum values of the 
percentage of customer service in the arithmetically combined group 
value of weight coefficients 
W  is  33.08.  
Step 6: Selection of the planning solution   
After analysing acceptable planning solutions for developing the 
optimal Logistic Support Plan, the resource allocation was selected 
based on the values of weighting coefficients
Step 7: Detailed elaboration of the selected planning solution  
In this step, a customer service order with the allocated amount of 
resources in the observed planning period is elaborated.

Conclusion  
In logistics systems, there is often a need to make decisions 
regarding the allocation of limited resources. Resource allocation 
efficiency is measured by optimizing appropriate parameters such as 
demand size, resource capacity, task execution time, system latency, 
and cost, which are key elements in planning the logistics support of 
military operations. 
The considerable uncertainty and dynamics of the requirements 
generated by military units (users of logistic products and services), and, 
on the other hand, numerous limitations present in logistics indicate that 
logistics support planning is a crucial and challenging area of logistics. 
Optimal planning reduces or eliminates the uncertainty of future 
activities and maintains the system within the permissible (tolerant) 
framework of functionality in the observed future period. 
To plan logistics support well, it is necessary to have reliable data on 
customer requirements, as well as data on the availability of limited 
resources of the logistics system. In addition, quality planning implies 
applying modern methods, techniques, and software tools, which will 
provide greater rationality and objectivity in determining the variants of 
planning solutions.  
This paper has shown that techniques for prioritizing customer 
requirements and resource allocation provide a possibility of agile 
planning of logistics support and ensure optimal allocation of limited 
resource capacities of the logistic system. The goal in future research is 
to consider the possibility of applying the allocation of multiple resources, 
in multiperiod, according to priorities, and by substitution of resources to 
finally obtain, as much as it is possible, an automated logistics support 
plan ready to respond to all possible scenarios. 
Due to the extraordinary dynamism and heterogeneity of 
phenomena in logistics activities, logistics support planning cannot be 
fully and easily formalized and automated. In that sense, the efficiency of 
logistics support planning depends on creativity, organizational skills, and 
innovation in the work of logistics staff.

ВИД СТАТЬИ: оригинальная научная статья 
Резюме:  
Введение: В статье представлена модель планирования 
логистической поддержки в условиях ограниченных логистических 
ресурсов, основанная на приоритезации запросов клиентов и 
распределении ресурсов. Лица, принимающие решения, играют 
ключевую роль в эффективном и справедливом распределении 
ресурсов, поскольку они определяют приоритеты среди различных 
запросов пользователей.  
Методы. Для определения степени важности требований 
пользователя были применены методы приоритизации запросов с 
использованием номинальной шкалы, порядковой шкалы и шкалы 
отношений, а также пять методов преобразования ранга в 
весовые коэффициенты. Метод сортировки запросов 
использовался для определения относительных приоритетов, в 
то время как эвристический алгоритм определения медианы 
Кемени использовался для объединения индивидуально 
ранжированных запросов в групповой ранг. Чтобы уравновесить 
противоположные требования пользователей, использовались 
консенсусные меры группового принятия решений. Для получения 
оптимального планировочного решения логистической поддержки 
применены методы и приемы распределения ресурсов.   
Результаты: Разработана модель адаптивного планирования 
логистической поддержки в условиях ограниченных ресурсных 
возможностей логистической системы. 
Вывод: Предложенная модель может быть эффективно 
применена и в других сферах распределения ресурсов.  
Ключевые слова: планирование логистики, приоритезация 
запросов, сортировка, преобразование рангов, веса, распределение 
ресурсов.

ВРСТА ЧЛАНКА: оригинални научни рад 
Сажетак: 
Увод: У раду је представљен модел планирања логистичке 
подршке у условима ограничених логистичких ресурса на основу 
приоритизације захтева купаца и алокације ресурса. Доносиоци 
одлука имају кључну улогу у ефикасној и правичној алокацији 
ресурса јер дају приоритет различитим захтевима корисника.  
Методе: Технике приоритизације захтева које користе 
номиналну скалу, ординалну скалу и скалу односа, као и пет 
метода за претварање ранга у тежинске коефицијенте, 
примењене су како би се одредио степен значаја захтева 
корисника. За утврђивање релативних приоритета коришћен је 
метод тријаже захтева, док је хеуристички алгоритам за 
одређивање медијане Кемениja коришћен за консолидацију 
индивидуално рангираних захтева у групни ранг. Ради 
балансирања супротстављених захтева корисника, коришћене 
су мере консензуса групног одлучивања. За добијање 
оптималног планског решења логистичке подршке примењене 
су методе и технике расподеле ресурса.  
Резултати: Развијен је модел за адаптивно планирање 
логистичке подршке у условима ограничених ресурсних 
капацитета логистичког система.  
Закључак: Предложени модел може се ефикасно применити и у 
другим областима алокације ресурса.  
Кључне речи: планирање логистике, приоритизација захтева, 
тријажа, претварање ранга у пондере, алокација ресурса.

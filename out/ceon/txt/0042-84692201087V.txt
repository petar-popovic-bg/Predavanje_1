Abstract: 
Introduction/purpose: The paper provides a review of recent research in 
the field of digital training applied in the Serbian Military Academy flight 
training. Flight training represents the foundation of successful education 
of military pilots. Its division is based on the environment and a phase of 
realization. The main part and the core of successful flight training is basic 
flight training. This training phase has experienced significant changes 
with the introduction of the Technically Advanced aircraft (TAA) which is 
characterized by a high degree of digitalization not only of the cockpit but 
also of other aircraft systems. Consequently, a different methodological 
approach to training is needed, including a digital training concept. The 
paper shows the achievements and certain solutions based on some

elements of digital training concepts used in the basic flight training at the 
Serbian Military Academy.  
Methods: The scientific approach is used in the evaluation of aircraft 
cockpit digitalization and in the implementation of a new training concept 
in the basic flight training in the Serbian Military Academy. 
Results: Based on the methodological analysis used, the importance and 
the values of the digital training concept in basic flight training are shown. 
Conclusion: Although the digital training concept is not mandatory in the 
existing flight training model in the Serbian Military Academy, it proves to 
be a valuable asset. Its potential is significant and, to a certain extent, it 
can change the nature of basic flight training. Due to digital training, 
cadets can fly more safely and their flying skills are acquired faster. In 
accordance with new modern aircraft acquisition in the Serbian Air Force, 
every aspect of the digital training concept has to be carefully considered, 
especially in the basic flight training phase, including conversion to new 
aircraft types.    
Key words: flight training, glass cockpit, digital training, training 
devices. 
Introduction 
Flight training represents the foundation of successful education of 
military pilots. Its division is based on the environment and a phase of 
realization. Regarding the environment, it can be realized on the ground 
or in the air. Military flight training consists of four phases: primary, basic, 
advanced, and combat flight training. The main part and the core of 
successful flight training is basic flight training. This phase is usually 
completed on a piston-engine or turboprop trainer. Acquisitions of new 
types of planes in this phase involve many changes and bring new 
challenges. It is necessary to adapt the methodological manuals, the 
study curriculum and the syllabus based on the Lasta airplane as well as 
many other elements of the flight training system. In recent years, the 
biggest challenge has been the introduction of a digital glass cockpit from 
the very beginning of flight training. It demands a new approach, even 
using a variety of commercially available tools and devices to make the 
digital concept effective for a new era of basic flight training. 
Basic flight training in the Military Academy    
In the Military Academy, the study in military aviation is divided in 
two main parts. The first one, lasting five semesters, is realized in the 
Military Academy headquarters situated in Belgrade. The main goal of 
this phase is theoretical preparation for the upcoming flight training in an 
airbase near Belgrade. This phase is also considered as a preparation 
phase in terms of core activities (flying) during studying. The second 
phase is flight training on airplanes and helicopters and it is crucial for the 
cadets - pilots. Having in mind that the first (preparation) phase has a 
very important role regarding the quality of flight training as a crown of 
the education process, there is a permanent task to improve this process 
and make it more effective and safer (Vlacic et al, 2014). 
Flight training represents the foundation of successful education of 
military pilots. The main constituents of flight training are the environment 
and a phase of realization. Regarding the environment, it can be realized 
on the ground or in the air. Military flight training consists of four phases: 
primary, basic, advanced, and combat flight training.  
Basic flight training is considered to be the most important phase of 
flight training and the core of the successful process of making future 
pilots. It is aimed at mastering the necessary aircraft handling skills. The 
curriculum contains basic flying, aerobatic flying, navigation flying, 
instrument flying, formation flying, and night flying. The flight training 
duration is between 80 and 130 flight hours, and it depends on the 
airplane or helicopter types. These can be piston engine or turboprop 
airplanes, even simple jet trainers or helicopters.   
The first step for each of these phases is the ground (theoretical) 
preparation, which is an integral part of flight training. The division by the 
phases has not been changed for almost half a century and it would not 
be changed in the near future. The main teaching methods in the air 
have not been changed, either. However, the main changes have 
emerged because of the introduction of new training aircraft, regardless 
of airplane or helicopter types (Vlačić et al, 2015). 
Recognizing the importance of the basic type of training, the Serbian 
Air Force very carefully approached the design of a new type of piston 
engined aircraft, named Lasta. This type of aircraft has been included in 
the Military Academy’s flight training syllabus since 2017. The syllabus is 
based on two aircraft types during the training in the Academy: the basic 
flight training on the Lasta (Swallow) aircraft precedes the training on the 
advanced jet trainer G-4 (Figure 1) followed by the basic combat training 
and the introduction to fighter fundamentals (IFF).

The Lasta training aircraft, as a new type in the Serbian Air Force 
service, brings a lot of technical improvements compared to older training 
aircraft. One of the biggest improvements is the implementation of a 
digital glass cockpit (Figure 2).  
Figure 2 – Digital cockpit of the Lasta aircraft  
Рис. 2 – Стеклянная кабина самолета „Ласта“ 
Слика 2 – Дигитални кабински простор авиона „ласта” 
Lasta’s glass cockpit includes the most modern navigation and 
communications equipment currently available on the market for this 
category of aircraft. Although the flight characteristics of the Lasta aircraft 
are adapted to beginners, the technical level of the aircraft equipment 
mentioned above requires a great effort towards achieving the required 
level of confidence and safe operating. It was necessary to make 
adaptations of the methodological manuals, the study curriculum and the 
syllabus concerning the Lasta airplane, as well as many other elements 
of the flight training system.  
Digital glass cockpit 
A glass cockpit is an aircraft cockpit that features electronic (digital) 
instrument displays, typically large LCD screens, rather than the 
traditional style of analog dials and gauges. While a traditional cockpit is 
based on numerous mechanical gauges to display information, a glass 
cockpit uses several displays driven by flight management systems that 
can be adjusted to display flight information as needed. This simplifies 
aircraft operation and navigation and allows pilots to focus only on the 
most pertinent information (Ison, 2016). A glass cockpit is the core of the 
Technologically Advanced Aircraft (TAA) which is a modern term used to 
describe light aircraft with advanced equipment on board, specifically 
advanced avionics like GPS and glass panel displays. 
Glass cockpit displays rely on computerized systems that integrate 
multiple data inputs and controls. Glass cockpit displays can present 
more information in the space required for conventional instrument 
panels, but the increase in information places greater demands on pilot's 
attention and creates a risk of overloading pilots with more information 
than they can effectively monitor and process. The complexity of the 
integrated computerized systems that drive glass cockpit displays may 
also limit pilots’ understanding of the functionality of the underlying 
systems (National Transportation Safety Board, 2010). 
The analysis of both the cockpit layouts and their benefits and 
disadvantages points out to a few facts (Vlacic et al, 2014): 
− The information in a digital glass cockpit is more precise and, due 
to computer screens, can be displayed much more ergonomically; 
− Glass cockpits have a tremendous amount of information available 
to pilots, which is not available from cockpits with analog gauges; 
− Disadvantages of traditional analog instrumentation are the 
multitudes of mechanical components so glass cockpits also provide an 
element of maintenance simplicity; 
− Analog gauges can be more easily interpreted during rapid 
changes in airspeed and altitude; 
− Pilots with glass panels may also be spending more time looking 
at the displays instead of looking outside; 
− In case of turbulence and emergencies, pilots using glass cockpits 
may touch and activate wrong buttons because there are so many of 
them in a small area; 
− Flying a glass cockpit aircraft requires a different cognitive style of 
thinking. 
It can be concluded that if we want to attain a desired level for safe 
flying with a glass cockpit, ground training with the use of synthetic 
devices is also necessary. The process of re-training pilots trained in 
traditional analog cockpits will not be so easy and fast and it takes time 
which has to be determined in the next phase of acquiring the Lasta fleet. 
Because of the cockpit complexity and our study program curriculum 
timeline, it will be impossible to use the Lasta in the process of selecting 
future pilots in the primary flight training phase.  
In today’s fully integrated cockpit, learning how to use these new 
tools effectively, while still maintaining the control of the aircraft, is 
something that will keep the training squadron busy for years to come. 
For pilots who are going to be converted to a glass cockpit and want to 
gain numerous advantages of modern avionics, there are a number of 
training options. Many suppliers provide Internet-downloaded trainers 
free of charge, and there are free online interactive courses. Commercial 
DVDs and training simulators are extremely useful, too. However, 
realistic flight training using the specific system in busy airspace during 
less-than-ideal weather with an experienced flight instructor is a must. 
(Decker, 2013) 
Also, manufacturers of the before mentioned equipment provide only 
a small part of educational software (for each device separately), but 
such educational software is not tailored to the specific layout of Lasta’s 
cockpit (Vlačić, 2011). 
Digital training  
It is important to understand the difference between learning and 
training. Тhey are inextricably linked, but they are unique aspects of any 
educational process. Training is the giving of information and knowledge, 
through speech, the written word or other methods of demonstration in a 
manner that instructs the trainee. Learning is the process of absorbing 
that information in order to increase skills and abilities and make use of it 
under a variety of contexts. 
The quality of learning will rely largely on the quality of training.  
Training focuses more on the development of new skills or skill sets 
that will be used. Training is the process each new trainee (cadet) goes 
through when joining a flight squadron to learn how to carry out day-to-
day operations, know how their airplane works and how job-specific tools 
operate in order to carry out their responsibilities. In essence, through 
training, the goal is not to reshape the behavior of an individual rather the 
point is to teach the cadet how things are done so that they can then 
carry out a process on their own.  
Digitalization is today an inevitable part of any learning or training 
proccess, especially in modern aviation. There are many definitions of 
what digital learning is, but a clear definition of digital training is lacking.  
Digital learning is "learning facilitated by technology that gives 
students some element of control over time, place, path and/or pace" 
(GOSA, 2021). Also, digital learning is any type of learning that is 
accompanied by technology or by instructional practice that makes 
effective use of technology. Digital technologies are electronic tools, 
systems, devices and resources that generate, store or process data 
(Victoria State Government, 2021). Digital learning is sometimes 
confused with online learning or e-learning; digital learning encompasses 
the aforementioned concepts. Digital learning requires a combination of 
technology, digital content, and instruction.  
Technology is the mechanism that delivers content. It facilitates how 
students receive content. It includes Internet access and hardware, which 
can be any Internet access device – from a desktop to a laptop to an 
iPad to a smartphone. Technology is the tool, not the instruction. 
Digital content is the high-quality academic material delivered 
through technology. It is what students learn. It ranges from new 
engaging, interactive and adaptive software to classic literature, from 
video lectures to games. It is not simply a PDF file of a text or a 
PowerPoint presentation. 
However, there is no distinctive definition of digital training. Some 
sources indicate that it is an evolution of e-learning that uses the Internet 
to make online training courses. Computers, tablets, mobiles or even 
connected objects, are all means to easily access this type of training. 
Nevertheless, digital training has much broader contest.  
For the purpose of this paper, we consider digital training to be 
training which includes a variety of digital devices in order to improve the 
quality of flight training, having in mind the previously mentioned 
differences between learning and training.  
Implementation of the digital training concept  
Aircraft manufacturers usually deliver training aircraft to the end user 
with a wide spectrum of additional training devices (Vlačić et al, 2015), 
but the developer of the Lasta has not provided training devices and 
simulators yet. The Military Academy staff had to develop or procure the 
whole spectrum of training devices in order to make the training process 
more effective. These devices are part of the set that makes up the 
concept of digital training on the Lasta airplane. In the meantime, cockpit 
digitalization has become reality in a few new acquisitions, including the 
Airbus H-145M utility helicopter or the Mi-35M combat helicopter. In this 
way, acquisition and equipment with adequate devices for pilot training 
become a necessity and one of the priorities in aviation modernization 
(Vlačić et al, 2015). 
The main changes in the flight training process occured due to new 
airplanes equipped with modern hardware and software in different 
domains. This is most obvious in the aircraft cockpit layout. The main 
goal of their incorporation was a higher level of flight safety, better 
efficiency of training and, most importantly, higher combat efficiency of 
the airplane as a platform. Higher demands placed in front of trainees 
were somewhat compensated with a wide use of flight trainers/simulators 
and other digital training devices. Their use in modern training is 
inevitable. For many years, training devices were developed and 
produced exclusively by original manufacturers. This led to high prices, 
caused by industrial monopoly and the application of rigid industrial and 
military standards. Remarkable development of hardware and software 
has made these items more affordable than ever if price and 
performances are considered. This fact opened the door for less 
specialized personnel to create and develop some training devices. The 
great change was also made by wide recognition and involvement of 
Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components in the process of creating 
systems for military use. These facts enabled less experienced staff to 
create their own digital devices and their own approach to the creation of 
the digital training concept. 
The focus of the use of digital devices has been placed on basic 
training. The nature of basic flight training requires not only acquiring 
basic knowledge and skills but a student in training also has to "to learn 
how to learn". "Inserting" a student-pilot in a real cockpit without 
introduction and adaptation to digital devices reduces the effectiveness of 
training in many ways.  
In creating the concept, the ways of training by which the greatest 
success is achieved are taken into account. Regardless of different 
scientific views (Kåre & Sigbjørn, 2018), it is undeniable that a high level 
of adaptation of knowledge and skills is achieved through one's own 
practice and repetition of actions and procedures, instead of simply 
listening and watching.  
Digital training has to be divided in several levels in accordance with 
training objectives i.e. what specific and useful knowledge, skills, and 
techniques have to be developed in certain phases of training.  
The digital concept in basic flight training contains several levels 
including: 
Interactive learning materials; 
Flight Simulator based on commercial software; 
Virtual reality (VR) devices; 
Learning Management System (LMS);and 
Other training hardware and software. 
Interactive learning materials 
Today there is a broad range of interactive learning materials which 
provide cadets - pilots with the aviation knowledge they require to 
prepare for theoretical examinations and to become safe and competent 
pilots. After evaluation, the Military Academy opted for the CAE Oxford 
Aviation Academy interactive materials in compliance with the EASA1 
standards. These materials have the form of full color textbooks and 
multimedia computer-based training (CBT), both comprehensively 
covering the theory but delivering it in a different way. 
Within CBT, each lesson is accompanied by clear precise narration 
which leads students through each essential teaching point. The lessons 
are built with an effective combination of graphics, animations, audio 
voice-overs, textual key-points and revision questions, providing a unique 
and effective way of mastering difficult concepts in an engaging way.  
During the six years of CBT application, cadets demonstrated better 
results2 in subjects in which CBT were used. The comprehensible 
manner gave cadets a lot of good examples and advice on how to deal 
with problems in future flight training.

Also, embedding new cockpit instruments imposed new training 
approaches. Because of the Garmin origin, the Military Academy 
introduced the dedicated Garmin software and hardware simulator for its 
complex devices such as Garmin G500/600. The basic variants of this 
simulator can be viewed and downloaded at the Garmin support pages 
(Garmin, 2021). This simulator allows cadets to perform basic functions 
within the Garmin system. It is possible to learn how to input data and 
frequencies using tips and tricks for “best practices”. Cadets learn to 
navigate using flight plans and GPS direct courses. They are able to 
navigate pages and page groups of the Flight Management System, 
while recognizing the most important functions using tips and tricks. The 
first generation of cadet pilots who started their flight training after 
practicing on this simulator shows better performance in the basic stages 
of the flight syllabus. 
LMS in the flight training preparation phase 
The Military Academy staff has decided to implement MOODLE e-
learning platform in the Military Aviation study program 
(Dynamic Learning Environment) is a free source e-learning system shell 
(LMS), written in PHP. It is an important tool for e-learning and blended 
learning which provides a framework for preparing courses and for 
learning over it. Various content is provided over this system shell (texts, 
pictures, optional files, links, multimedia etc.), but the tasks related to 
them that can be scored are also important (assigning tasks in the form 
of online texts, file, varied types of tests, offline tasks, etc.). This system 
unifies and presents, in a single surface, all the services that are 
otherwise applied by teachers on parallel surfaces, often offline (sharing 
documents and information, sending messages, evaluation, etc.) 
(Namestovski & Arsovic, 2013).  
Microsoft Flight Simulators 
Microsoft Flight Simulator X, also known as FSX, is a 2006 flight 
simulation computer game originally developed and published by 
Microsoft for Microsoft Windows. It is the next in the sequence after 
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004. This software can be classified as virtual 
modeling on a computer workstation. One of the enduring problems with 
any flight simulator is a restricted field of view (FOV) imposed by the 
computer display screen. This restriction severely limits peripheral vision, 
which in turn detracts from perceived realism. 
The external graphic card Matrox TripleHead2Go expanded Flight 
Simulator X across three displays (Figure 3), providing a panoramic view 
that enables users to see more of their virtual cockpit and improves flight 
visibility at the same time. This extended view provides a more realistic 
flight experience by fully engaging peripheral vision on the side displays.  
As a further level, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 was introduced in 
order to support FSX.  Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 was released in 
2020, for Microsoft Windows, with a virtual reality (VR) version. Flight 
Simulator simulates the topography of the entire Earth using data from 
Bing Maps. Artificial intelligence (AI) generates three-dimensional 
representations of Earth's features, using its cloud computing to render 
and enhance visuals, and real-world data to generate real-time weather 
and its effects. Flight Simulator has a physics engine to provide realistic 
flight control surfaces, with over 1,000 simulated surfaces, as well as 
realistic wind modelled over hills and mountains. Some places are 
handcrafted, introduced in region-specific updates. To augment its 
realism, AI also incorporates real-time elements like natural weather and 
real-world air traffic. The gameplay includes new features such as 
landing challenges and helpers.

The developer scanned the interiors and exteriors of aircraft with a 
3D scanner to create their realistic looks, polished with modeling and 
printing (Aysha, 2020). There are also realistic physics and weather 
systems, and utilization of real-world weather data. For instance, if it is 
raining somewhere in real life, it can rain in-game. Individual clouds have 
their own behaviors and will impact aircraft performance depending on its 
location within the system. Flight Simulator is the first flight simulator to 
enable worldwide visual flight rules (VFR), a feature not seen in 
contemporary flight simulators used by airlines to train and test pilots.  
Through cloud-based technology, Flight Simulator sends data to the 
computer in real time, with AI being utilized to extrapolate geometry from 
a blend of satellite and flyover imagery (Jensen, 2020). Other sources of 
data include terrain data for landscaping, data for foliage density, real-
time meteorological data, and air traffic updates. Cloud technology is 
used to calculate, among other things, the way air flows around natural 
structures such as mountains to cause pockets of turbulence, or streams 
in the world's real-time air traffic, and time of day and weather. 
Microsoft simulators are mainly used to demonstrate cockpit views 
and basic systems characteristics in the aircraft used in real flight 
training. To simulate domestic airplanes (UTVA-75, Lasta, Supergaleb G-
4) which are not involved in the FSX package, the specific add-ons have 
been created as a long-term process. Developing one’s own add-ons 
was the first step in creating a basic flight simulator. However, it is 
important to stress that during the flight-training phase in military jets (G-
4 Supergaleb in our case) a full-scale flight simulator is used. The use of 
a full flight simulator is expensive and impracticable in the basic training 
phase, which is our point of consideration.  
When speaking about the assessment and worthiness of the kind of 
software such as Microsoft simulators, we have to mention what kinds of 
simulators and simulations exist on the market. Simulations can consist 
of virtual modeling on a computer workstation, part task devices with 
actual system hardware and software, or full-mission man-in-the-loop 
simulators with visual systems and motion. All have their place in the 
process, and all play a role in shortening development time and cost 
(Vlačić, 2011). 
Both versions of Microsoft Flight Simulators have been procured for 
the training process in the Military Academy. The main advantages are 
not only visual simulation but the possibility to connect many modern 
peripherals such as virtual reality and eye tracking devices.  
VR devices  
Virtual reality (VR) has been developed to facilitate human 
immersion into new computer-generated synthetic environments that 
block out the real world. Recent advancements in VR technologies 
enable users to interact with high resolution three-dimensional graphics 
without any significant video delay. This technological advancement for 
VR systems has reinforced its professional training applications, 
including those for aircraft pilots. Conventional flight simulator systems 
can generate realistic situational conditions, installing out-the-window 
scenery screens in front of their mockup cockpits with motion platforms, 
but the setting at such a level, which is costly and requires a 360° angle 
of-scenery screen, is still hard to implement. VR has the advantage of 
implementing the 360° angle-of horizontal - and vertical-scenery view for 
a lower cost. 
Pilots are exposed to a lot of safety-critical situations, and they have 
to practice recovery skills against all potentially dangerous situations. VR 
can show a better performance for this kind of dangerous situation 
training than conventional simulators due to its higher realism. Pilots also 
have to develop skills to manipulate modern electronic cockpit systems, 
including setting the objective heading direction on the electronic 
compass, magnifying/demagnifying the electronic map display, and 
switching communication radio frequencies with other channels. The 
high-cost conventional mockup simulators install the actual electronic 
cockpit hardware, for which all functionalities can be manipulated by 
manual controls (Chang-Geun, 2020). 
The main benefit of virtual reality in flight training is the immersive 
representation of the flight experience, providing some important learning 
advantages over traditional flight simulators. The key benefits for flight 
schools include reduced training costs, cost savings on aircraft 
familiarization training, and faster training of students. 
Virtual Reality (VR) is the concept of being immersed into a 
computer-generated environment with a visual, audible and optionally 
haptical representation of the environment. This environment, e.g. a 
room, landscape or a cockpit, may be presented to the user through a 
screen or a head mounted display (headset). The user may be able to 
interact with the environment, e.g. through gestures or physical buttons 
or levers. 
VR offers new opportunities for significant improvement of teaching 
and learning as subjects can be taught/learnt in a very different way 
instead of reading a textbook or listening to a lecturer. 
One of the most important aspects of learning is knowledge 
retention – the ability to remember what has been learnt. This is 
especially true for flight crews who must memorize dozens of checklists, 
rules, and procedures. Studies have shown that VR-assisted learning 
has the potential of improving knowledge retention by up to 400%, 
adding value to the time spent studying. Better knowledge retention 
means less retraining and, in the end, better pilots who remember the 
emergency checklist better thanks to VR-assisted learning. 
VR engages the student much more in the learning process, thus 
making the student remember more of what he or she learns. This is an 
obvious advantage when performing tasks as a flight crew where 
complex procedures must be memorized. 
Studies have shown a dramatic reduction in training time when using 
VR simulations – for flight training application as much as one year down 
to four months. Some benefits that provide training time reduction are 
depth perception, 360° vision, scalability, and modularity (VRpilot, 2021). 
The Military Academy uses the Oculus Rift VR device which is one 
of typical representatives in this device category (Figure 4). 
Figure 4 – Oculus Rift VR in basic flight training 
Рис. 4 – Oculus Rift VR в основной летной подготовке 
Слика 4 – Oculus Rift VR у основној летачкој обуци 
The Oculus Rift VR headset uses gaze tracking and IR LED sensors 
to identify the user's position and, at the same time, to interact with the 
virtual environment. Users can move freely within their physical 
environment - sit, stand, walk, turn, duck, and dodge as they desire. 
Similarly, it is possible to simulate the aerial environment as well as the 
image of the aircraft cockpit. A VR headset enables a stereo image of the 
pilots' workspace and gaze sweeping inside and outside the cockpit. The 
headset has an OLED display with 2060 X 1200 resolution and a 90Hz 
refresh rate. The field of view (FOV) is 110 º and the tracking area is 12.7 
by 27.94 cm'. The sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, and 
magnetometers. The system enables full 360-degree positional tracking.  
Other training hardware and software 
The commercial flight simulator created in the Military Academy 
provides connection for many other devices that can be used in cadets' 
training and evaluation. The most important is the GP3 Desktop Eye 
Tracker device.  
In nearly all human-computer interactions, the most basic point of 
connection between an interface and its user is the eye. Eye tracking has 
been an important source of information about perception and cognition 
for more than 50 years. It has been utilized to study a diverse number of 
topics such as the patterns of fixations and saccades while reading a 
text, the workload of pilots during different phases of flight, the 
application of different scan patterns in flight training, the role of pilots' 
monitoring strategies in flight performance and the effectiveness of visual 
advertisements among many others. In the Military Academy case, pilot’s 
eye movement patterns are recorded by using the GP3 Desktop Eye 
Tracker. The GP3 Desktop Eye Tracker is a complete eye tracking 
system used as a device for measuring eye positions and eye 
movement.  
The role of the GP3 Desktop Eye Tracker is to make assessment 
during flight simulation. The assessment is done regarding the senses 
and skills necessary for flying as well as piloting skills in the air. The 
Piloting techniques are assessed in the air according to standard 
practices for monitoring, assessment, and evaluation.   
Assessment helps cadets to improve their ability to successfully 
cope with the flight syllabus and develop the required pilot aptitudes.  
The biggest contribution of this kind of equipment is in improving the 
pilot selection process using eye tracking tools (Vlačić et al, 2019). 
The Sky Demon is one of numerous electronic flight bag software 
programs available on the market. It enables flight planning as well as 
GPS navigation in the air. Its special features include real-time updates 
of aeronautical information. For navigation training purposes only, the 
internal simulation software, called the X-plane, enables the simulation of 
the flight along the planned route. Furthermore, it is possible to connect 
the Sky Demon in the simulation mode with Microsoft Flight Simulator via 
the FSX2SkyDemon application available on the Google Play Store. This 
small application receives the data from the FSX software and presents 
the information about the aircraft performance and position in the form of 
a track plot on top of the Google Earth maps. At the same time, it 
forwards the data to the Sky Demon software and makes it look like the 
user is flying a real airplane. Real-time aeronautical information from the 
Sky Demon, especially the information about the wind has a feedback 
impact on the aircraft performance in FSX. 
For navigation training, the Sky Demon software installed on a tablet 
is connected with Microsoft Flight Simulators (Figure 5).

Diversity and fine balance of devices used in the showed digital 
concept provided a step forward into better basic flight training. 
According to internal documents, there were no failures in basic flight 
training after the implementation of the digital training concept. 
Conclusion 
Basic flight training is considered as the most important phase of 
flight training and a core of a successful process of making future military 
pilots. This training phase has experienced significant changes with the 
introduction of the Lasta piston engine trainer which belongs to the 
Technically Advanced Aircraft category. This aircraft is characterized by 
a high degree of cockpit digitalization and aircraft systems as a whole. 
The technical level of the Lasta aircraft equipment requires a great effort 
towards achieving a required level of confidence and safe operation. In 
order to attain a desired level of safe flying with a glass cockpit, ground 
training with the use of digital synthetic devices is also necessary. 
The developer of the Lasta has not provided training devices and 
simulators yet. The Military Academy staff developed and procured a 
whole spectrum of training devices in order to make the training process 
more effective. Digital training as a type of training includes a variety of 
digital devices in order to improve the quality of flight training. In the case 
of basic flight training in the Military Academy, the digital concept of 
training consists of: 
Interactive learning materials; 
Flight Simulator based on commercial software; 
VR devices; 
LMS; and 
Other training hardware and software. 
The first generation of cadets - pilots who started their flight training 
after practicing on this simulator shows a better performance in the basic 
stages of the flight syllabus. The COTS based simulator was the core for 
other peripherals. 
VR offered new opportunities to significantly enhance the flight 
training process. Cadets learn faster and more efficiently while 
remembering the lessons taught better. 
The GP3 Desktop Eye Tracker has proved to be an assessment tool 
during the simulated flight training. Assessment is done regarding the 
senses and skills necessary for flying and piloting skills in the air. The 
biggest contribution of this kind of equipment is in the improvement of the 
pilot selection process using eye tracking tools. 
Despite the fact that the digital training concept is not mandatory in 
the existing flight training model in the Serbian Military Academy, it 
proves valuable. Its potential is considerable, and, to a certain extent, it 
can change the nature of basic flight training. Due to the digital training 
concept, cadets can fly more safely and their flying skills are acquired 
faster.

Резюме: 
Введение/цель: В статье представлен обзор последних 
исследований в области концепции электронного обучения, 
применяемой в летной подготовке в Военной академии Республики 
Сербия. Летная подготовка является залогом успешного обучения 
военных летчиков. Она подразделяется на этап освоения 
окружения и этап реализации. Главной частью и ядром успешной 
летной подготовки является основная летная подготовка. Этот 
этап обучения потерпел значительные изменения, вследствие 
внедрения технически усовершенствованных самолетов (TAA), 
для которых характерна высокая степень цифровизации не 
только стеклянной кабины, но и системы самолета в целом. В 
данной связи, необходим иной методологический подход к 
обучению, включающий концепцию электронного обучения. В 
статье представлен ряд достижений и решений, используемых в 
основной летной подготовке в Военной академии Республики 
Сербия, с применением элементов концепции электронного 
обучения. 
Методы: Используя научный подход, был проведен анализ 
цифровизации стеклянной кабины самолета и результатов 
внедрения новой концепции обучения в основную летную 
подготовку в Военной академии Республики Сербия. 
Результаты: На основании проведенного методологического 
анализа выявлены значение и ценность концепции электронного 
обучения в рамках основной летной подготовки. 
Выводы: Вопреки тому, что концепция электронной подготовки не 
является обязательной частью существующей модели летной 
подготовки в Военной академии Республики Сербия, она является 
весьма значительной и ценной. Ее потенциал настолько 
значителен, что в определенной степени, может изменить 
характер основной летной подготовки. Концепция электронного 
обучения способствует безопасности курсантов в будущих 
полетах, а также ускорению процесса приобретения летных 
навыков. В связи с приобретением новых современных самолетов  
ВВС и ПВО Республики Сербия, каждый аспект концепции 
электронной подготовки должен быть тщательно рассмотрен, 
особенно на этапе основной летной подготовки, включая этап 
перехода к новым типам самолетов. 
Ключевые слова: летная подготовка, стеклянная кабина, 
электронное обучение, учебные средства.

Увод/циљ: У раду су представљена недавна истраживања у 
области концепта дигиталне обуке примењеног у летачкој обуци 
на Војној академији Републике Србије, која чини основу успешног 
образовања војних пилота. Њена подела заснована је на окружењу 
и фази реализације. Главни део и основу успешне летачке обуке 
представља основна летачка обука. Ова фаза обуке доживела је 
значајне промене увођењем технички напредних авиона (ТАА) који 
се одликују високим степеном дигитализације кабинског простора 
и система авиона у целини. Сходно томе, потребан је другачији 
методолошки приступ обуци, укључујући концепт дигиталне 
обуке. Приказана су достигнућа и поједина решења која се користе 
у основној летачкој обуци на Војној академији, уз примену 
елемената дигиталних концепата обуке. 
Методе: Користећи научни приступ извршен је увид у 
дигитализацију пилотских кабинских простора и имплементације 
новог концепта у основну летачку обуку на Војној академији 
Републике Србије. 
Резултати: На основу примењене методe анализе приказани су 
значај и вредности концепта дигиталне обуке у основној летачкој 
обуци. 
Закључак: Иако концепт дигиталне обуке није обавезан у 
постојећем моделу летачке обуке на Војној академији Србије, 
показало се да је веома значајан. Његов потенцијал је велики и, до 
одређеног нивоа, може променити карактер основне летачке 
обуке. Захваљујући концепту дигиталне обуке, кадети касније 
могу безбедније управљати летелицама и брже стицати летачке 
вештине. У складу са набавком нових савремених авиона у Ратном 
ваздухопловству и противваздухопловној одбрани Војске Србије, 
сваки аспект концепта дигиталне обуке мора се пажљиво 
размотрити, посебно у фази основне летачке обуке, укључујући и 
фазе преласка на нове типове авиона. 
Кључне речи: летачка обука, стаклени кабински простор, 
дигитална обука, средства за обуку.
